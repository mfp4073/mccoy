Hull, William (June 24, 1753 - Nov. 29, 1825), soldier, as the son of Joseph and Eliza (Clark) Hull, and fifth in descent from Richard Hull, who emigrated from Derbyshire, England, to Massachusetts at some time prior to 1634.  The family later removed to Derby, Conn., and here William was born.  He graduated from Yale College at the age of nineteen, studied law at Litchfield, Conn., and was admitted to the bar in 1775.  In July of that year he joined the American army before Boston as captain of the militia company from his native town.  During the Revolutionary War he saw active and almost continuous service, taking part in the battles of White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Monmouth, and Stony Point, and commanding, for three successive winters, the American advanced lines just above New York City.  In these campaigns he displayed bravery and energy, won the commendation of both General Washington and Congress, and was promoted to the rank of major and later to that of lieutenant-colonel.  After the close of the Revolution, he practiced law at Newton, Mass., the love of his wife, Sarah Fuller, whom he had married in 1781.  He adopted his nephew, Isaac Hull, son of his brother Joseph.  In 1784 and 1793 he went on missions to Canada.  He helped to put down Shays's rebellion, served as a judge of the court of common pleas and as a state senator, was prominent in organizing the Society of the Cincinnati, and became known as an ardent supported of the Jeffersonian party. On Mar. 22, 1805, he was appointed by President Jefferson governor of the newly organized Michigan Territory.  As governor he secured from the Indians large cessions of land in southeastern Michigan, his energy in this undertaking contributing to the rise of Indian discontent and hostility in the Northwest.  In the spring of 1812, while on an official visit to Washington, he was persuaded against his wishes to accept a commission as brigadier-general and the command of the army designed to defend Michigan Territory and attack Upper Canada from Detroit.  Although he had pointed out to the War Department the necessity of a naval force of Lake Erie to insure the communications of Detroit, he had made at the same time the utterly impracticable suggestion that a superior American army at Detroit might force the British to Abandon their ships on the lake and thus secure naval control without the expense of building a fleet.  Upon this unfortunate suggestion the Administration based its plans for Hull's campaign, and to this extent Hull was responsible for the faulty strategy.  On July 5, 1812, he arrived at Detroit with an army of some 2,000 men, the majority of them Ohio militia.  A week later, pursuant to orders from Washington, he crossed into Canada.  At this time his force was superior to that of the British at Amherstbury, and it is possible that a sudden blow at that post might have resulted in success.  Hull delayed in the relief that the Canadian militia would desert and make his task easier.  Events now began to turn against him.  British and Indian Detachment cut his exposed communications along the short of the lake and the Detroit River.  The British captured the American post at Mackinac, with the result that the Michigan Indians openly espoused the British side.  Gen. Henry Dearborn, who had been expected to create a diversion on the Niagara River, failed to do so, and British reinforcements reach Amherstbury from that quarter.  Gen. Isaac Brock, lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, an energetic and very able soldier, took command in person.  Hull retreated to Detroit, and after futile attempts to open his communications with Ohio, surrendered his army and fortifications to Brock on Aug. 16, 1812.  His excuses were that he was cut off from his base of supplies with provisions that would last a month at most, that he was unable to break through the encircling enemy, and that resistance would expose the population of the territory to Indian massacre.  The court martial which tried him upon charges of treason, cowardice, and neglect of duty found him guilty upon the second and third counts and sentenced him to be shot.  President Madison approved the sentence, but remanded its execution because of Hull's Revolutionary services.  These charges would hardly be sustained today.  Blame should fall, first, upon a faultily conceived plan of campaign, for which Hull was jointly responsible with his superiors, Secretary Eustis and President Madison; second, upon Hull's excessive concern for the safety of non-combatants (part of his own family among them), which was greater than a soldier can well afford to exercise.  His surrender without a battle was a blow to American morale from which it took nearly two years to recover.  Hull was dropped from the army and spent his remaining years with his family at Newton, Mass.  Three days after the General's surrender his nephew, Capt. Isaac Hull, commanded the <u>Constitution</u> in her victory over the <u>Guerriere</u>.<a href="e3200.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Hull, Isaac (Mar. 9, 1773 - Feb 13, 1843), naval officer, was descended from Richard Hull who migrated from Dorchester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., in 1639.  The family moved to Derby, a near-by town, where Lieut. Joseph Hull, an officer of the Revolution, was born in 1750.  He married Sarah, daughter of Daniel Bennett, and built a house across the river in Huntington, now Shelton.  Here Isaac was born, the second of seven children, all sons.  When quite young he was adopted by his uncle, William Hull, and lived in Newton, Mass.  He went to sea at fourteen as a cabin boy and at sixteen was shipwrecked and saved the life of his captain.  Before he was twenty-one he commanded a ship and made deep-sea voyages.  He was appointed a lieutenant in the United States Navy, Mar. 9, 1798, and served in the naval war with France on board the frigate <u>Constitution</u>.  In 1800 he commanded a cutting-out expedition and captured a French armed ship at Porto Plata, Santo Domingo.  When the navy was reorganized at the conclusion of hostilities, Hull stood second on the new list of lieutenants, Mar. 3, 1801.  War with Tripoli soon followed and in 1803 he was given command of the schooner <u>Enterprise</u> and shortly after of the brig <u>Argus</u>, in which he took part in the attacks on Tripoli by Commodore Edward Preble's squadron in 1804.  On May 18 of that year he was promoted to commander.  In 1805 he cooperated with Gen. William Eaton in the assault and capture of Derne.  He was promoted to captain Apr. 23, 1806.  In the summer he returned to the United States and was employed on shore duty for nearly four years. In 1810 Hull was given command of the <u>Constitution</u>.  The next year he was sent to Europe with Joel Barlow, minister to France, and with specie for payment of the interest on the Dutch debt.  After having landed Barlow at Cherbourg and the money to the Texel, he spent several weeks in the English Channel.  One of his men deserted, claiming British protection, and the British admiral refused to give him up.  Consequently, when a British sailor swam to the <u>Constitution</u> and claimed protection as an American, Captain Hull refused to surrender him.  Trouble over this matter was expected, but did not come.  The <u>Constitution</u> returned to the United States early in 1812 and was thoroughly overhauled and made ready for service.  War against Great Britain was declared June 18.  On July 12 the <u>Constitution</u> sailed out of Chesapeake Bay, bound to New York to join the squadron of Commodore Rodgers.  She was chased nearly three days by five British men-of- war and only consummate seamanship enabled her to escape and take refuge in Boston.  She set sail on a cruise to the eastward Aug. 1, and on Aug. 19 fell in with the British frigate <u>Guerriere</u>.  After considerable maneuvering, during which the British ship fired rapidly but with little effect, about six o'clock in the afternoon the <u>Constitution</u> delivered her first broadside, within pistol-shot.  After fifteen minutes the <u>Guerriere's</u> mizzen-mast went over the side, in another quarter of an hour the mainmast followed, and about the same time the foremast also fell.  The <u>Guerriere</u> then surrendered, a total wreck.  Although the <u>Constitution</u> was superior in number of guns and men, the injury inflicted on her opponent was out of all proportion to the difference in force.  The British loss was fifteen killed and sixty-four wounded, eight of them mortally; the American seven killed and seven wounded.  The <u>Constitution</u> received some damage to her spars and rigging, while the <u>Guerriere</u>, a helpless hulk, could not be brought into port and was burned.  On this battle Captain Hull's fame chiefly rests.  His expert seamanship and training of his crew in gunnery have ever since been recognized by authorities as placing him among the ablest of naval commanders.  It was the first important naval battle of the war, and had he been defeated, the moral effect would have been disastrous.  He returned to Boston and was given a most enthusiastic reception.  He did not go to sea again during the war, since other officers had to be given their turn. He commanded the Boston Navy Yard a few months and then the Portsmouth Navy Yard.  In New York, Jan.2,1813, he married Anna McCurdy Hart, daughter of Capt. Elisha Hart of Saybrook.  They had no children.  In 1815 Hull was appointed navy commissioner, but he soon resigned this office to take command of the Boston Yard again.  During his eight years there charges of financial irregularities were brought against him, but a court of inquiry completely cleared him.  About this time he expressed advanced views on the subjects of naval policy, rank and command. His next sea service was in command of the Pacific Station.  He now first received the title of commodore.  Sailing in the frigate <u>United States</u>, Jan. 5,1824, accompanied by Mrs. Hull and her sister, he arrived at Callao, Peru, three months later.  At that time the South American colonies were ridding themselves of the Spanish yoke, and conditions were much disturbed.  During his stay of three years, Hull cooperated with the United States consul in the protection of American interests and the relief of ill-used American seamen and others.  He remained at Callao most of the time, though he cruised about frequently, visiting Valparaiso and other ports.  His relations with General Bolivar were friendly.  He was relieved in January 1827, and returned home.  Again charges, mainly of misusing funds which he controlled, were brought against him, this time before a congressional committee, and an investigation of his conduct of the Pacific Station was demanded.  Again, however, he was completely exonerated. After a leave of absence, he was appointed in 1829, commandant of the Washington Navy Yard, a post which he held six years, following which service another leave, obtained on account of Mrs. Hull's ill health, was spent in European travel.  In 1838 Hull was chairman of the Board of Revision, organized for the purpose of revising the tables of allowances for vessels of the navy, and upon completing this work, was ordered to the command of the Mediterranean Station.  Again Mrs. Hull and her sister went with him.  His flagship, the <u>Ohio</u>, arrived on Jan. 4, 1839 at Port Mahon, Minorca, the headquarters of the station.  His vessels, <u>Ohio</u>, <u>Cyane</u>, <u>Brandywine</u>, and later <u>Preble</u>, cruised about visiting various ports between Spain and Syria, looking out for the interests of American citizens, especially seamen, inquiring into and reporting on the condition of American commerce.  In 1841 the relations between the United States and Great Britain were strained to an alarming degree, owing to irritation over the northeastern boundary dispute, the Oregon question, and incidents arising from the Canadian rebellion of 1837.  On Mar. 24 Hull summoned his captains to a council of war on the flagship, but within a short time the trouble subsided.  On June 5, 1841, the Ohio sailed from Gibraltar homeward bound.  She arrived at Boston July 17, and on the 27th the commodore hauled down his flag for the last time.  In October he was given a year's leave of absence and spent the winter in New Haven.  In the summer of 1842 he bought a house, and settled down in Philadelphia, where he died a few months later.  His tomb is in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia. Hull was called by Farragut "as able a seaman as ever sailed a ship."  Edmund Quincy, who knew him personally, said "His manners were plain, bluff, and hearty, as became 'a rough and boisterous captain of the sea,' and indicated a good heart and a good temper, thought not incapable of being ruffled on a sufficient occasion."  There is some evidence of a temper not always easy to control, but he was kindly and took an interest in the young officers under him.  He was an active, busy man and had no patience with the shiftless and lazy.  He was thrifty but not penurious; he lived well and comfortably.  By good business judgment he accumulated a reasonable competence.  He bought real estate adjacent to the Boston Navy Yard and in other places.  Rents from this property formed a substantial part of his income.  While living in Washington he bought a slave, and gave him his freedom when he left there.

George Champlain Sibley  (Apr. 1, 1782 - Jan. 31, 1863), Indian agent, explorer, was born in Great Barrington, Mass, the descendant of John Sibley who emigrated from England to Plymouth about 1629 and later settled in Salem, Mass., and the son of John Sibley and Elizabeth (Hopkins) Sibley, the daughter of Samuel Hopkins, 1721 - 1803.  The boy was reared and educated in Fayetteville, N.C.  Appointed a clerk in the Indian bureau, he went to St. Louis and in 1808 accompanied the military detachment sent up the Missouri to a point near the site of the present Sibley, Jackson County, Mo., to build Fort Osage.  At this establishment, known also as Fiery Prairie Fort and Fort Clark, which included a government trading factory for the Indians and which for a decade was the furthermost outpost of the frontier, he was stationed as factor, and later as Indian agent, until about 1826.  In June and July 1811, escorted by a band of Osage warriors, he explored the Grand Saline, in present Woodward County, Okla., and in August he made a tour of investigation among the Kansas Indians.  Though his services in the War of 1812 seem not to have been conspicuous, they brought him the unofficial title of major, by which he was ever afterward known.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On Aug. 19, 1815, in St. Louis, he was married to Mary, the accomplished daughter of Rufus B. Easton, who accompanied him to the fort.  Here the Sibleys, in a large log building, furnished with many of the conveniences and some of the luxuries of city life brought by the bride on her wedding voyage, kept open house for all voyagers and wanderers who passed that way.  In 1825 Sibley served as one of the three commissioners to mark the Santa Fe trail from Council Grove to the Mexican boundary.  A year or two afterward he retired from government service and made his home near St. Charles, where he developed a large and beautiful estate.  In 1844, he was a delegate to both the state and the national Whig conventions and also an unsuccessful candidate for the state Senate.  Though a semi-invalid in his later years, he maintained a lively interest in political and social questions.  Both of the Sibleys held somewhat advanced views for their time and place, and Mrs. Sibley was one of the first avowed advocates of woman's suffrage.  In 1827 they established a school for girls on a nearby tract named by them Lindenwood.  This school, subsequently taken over by the presbytery of St. Louis and endowed with the gift of Sibley's estate, became Lindenwood College.  Sibley died at his home.  Though his criticism of the fur traders, whom he charged with swindling and corrupting the Indians, brought upon Sibley some abuse, he is generally praised for his honesty and good judgment, his hospitality and helpfulness, and his tactful relations with his savage wards.<a href="e3184.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
