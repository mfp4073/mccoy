<li id="c8081.1">[<a href="s14.htm#s186">S186</a>]  <i>Deacon Samuel Hull of CT</i>, page 8-10.  Deacon Samuel Hull of CT. (Editor's note: Phyllis Hughes, our HFA genealogist, chose this biography of Deacon Samuel Hull of Wallingford, New Haven Co., CT, specifically for Ilene Hull Peper (HFA #593), whose line stops at Henry Hull, b. 1820, who m. Eleanora Hermiston [sic].  This Henry Hull m. Elnora Humiston and information on this couple is found with this biography.  Contrary to the somewhat misleading account given at the beginning of this biography, Deacon Samuel Hull descends from the Richard Hull, immigrant, line &#8211; not the George Hull, immigrant, line.  Deacon Samuel Hull is the son of HFA #569 William Hull, Richard Hull line, and Alma Hall.  Dr. John Hull, mentioned early in this biography, was HFA #3, son of the immigrant, Richard Hull.  This biography appeared in the Commemorative Biographical Record of New Haven County, CT, Part 2, p. 996, published by J.H. Beers & Co. in Chicago, 1902.  Additional information on the Miller line which married into the Hull line has been omitted for this article.)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deacon Samuel Hull, one of the well known and much respected citizens of Wallingford, is a deacon of the Baptist Church, and a leading agriculturist of that town.  Born Feb 5, 1824, on the Hull homestead in the North Farms District of the town, he is a descendant of two of the oldest and most prominent families in this part of the State.  He has lead a long and useful life, acting from high principles and seeking a noble ideal.  The Hull family came from Derbyshire, England, and George Hull, its first representative in America, settled at Windsor, Conn., in 1636.  He was a surveyor.  He married Elizabeth Loomis.  Richard and Andrew Hull, whose relationship to George is not known, were at New Haven the year that gentleman was married, 1639.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. John Hull, an ancestor of Deacon Hull, was admitted a planter in 1661.  Seven years later he removed to Derby, where he remained until 1687, in that year coming to Wallingford to spend the rest of his life.  He died in 1711.  Dr. Hull was the first of the name in the town.  He exchanged the Hull homestead at Stratford for the Benjamin Lewis property at Wallingford.  On Oct. 17, 1671, he married, for his second wife, Mary Jones, and after her death Rebecca Turner became his wife, Sept. 20, 1699.  To him were born the following children: John, born March 14, 1661; Samuel, born Feb. 4, 1663; Mary, born Oct. 31, 1666; Joseph, born in 1668 (married Mary Nichols, of Derby); Benjamin, M.D., born Oct. 7, 1672 (married Elizabeth Andrews); Ebenezer, born in 1673 (married Lydia Mix); Richard, born in 1674; Dr. Jeremiah, born in 1679; and Asher.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Jeremiah Hull was a physician of more than ordinary skill and reputation, and was the proprietor of a considerable tract of land in Wallingford, where he died May 14, 1736.  On May 24, 1711, he married Hannah Cook, daughter of Samuel and Hope Cook.  She died Dec. 11, 1741.  To this union came the following children: John, born Nov. 13, 1712, who married Mary Andrews; Moses, born Dec. 21, 1714, who died Jun 3, 1736; Tabitha, born March 3, 1717; Hannah, born March 18, 1720; Anna; Jeremiah, born Jan. 5, 1729, mentioned below; Joseph, born March 24, 1733, who married Hannah Corbitt; Patience, born Oct. 20, 1735; and Keturah.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jeremiah Hull, noted above, was a prominent farmer and land owner in Wallingford, where his life was spent.  He died Aug. 24, 1790, and was buried in Wallingford.  On Jan. 18, 1753, he married Mary Merriman, who died Aug 22, 1774.  They had the following children: Caleb, born Dec. 1, 1753; Jeremiah; Samuel; and Ann, who married Jacob Rice.  To his second marriage were born: Benjamin; Levi; Hannah, who married a Mr. Heath, of Wallingford; and Eunice, who married a Mr. Pratt, of Essex, Connecticut.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Samuel Hull, son of Jeremiah, and grandfather of Deacon Hull, served as a soldier throughout the Revolutionary war.  He was born in Wallingford, married Lois Peck, and settled on the Hull homestead, on which he made extensive improvement, being one of the most enterprising farmers of his day in that section.  He was a lifelong agriculturist, and he and his wife died on the farm.  Mrs. Hull was a woman of much character and cultivation.  Her father's home was in Deerfield, and when that town was burned by the Indians, in 1704, Mrs. Hull's mother or grandmother (with the lapse of years some uncertainty has arisen), then a girl, secreted herself, with the town records and Bible, in the cellar of the only house left standing.  The Bible is now in the possession of Deacon Samuel Hull, our subject.  Samuel and Lois (Peck) Hull had three children: William; Sylvester, who married Delilah, daughter of Benajah Morse; and Lois, who married Miles Ives.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;William Hull, the father of Deacon Hull, for the most part educated himself, and was one of the best-known citizens of the town.  He owned and operated a tract of 100 acres in the North Farms District of Wallingford, on which he made many substantial improvements, and gave much attention to stock raising.  He did considerable business in getting out staves and other timber, and was a prosperous and fore-handed man.  In politics he was a Democrat, and in religion a member of the Baptist Church.  He died on his farm in 1849, and was buried in the Center Street cemetery.  William Hull married Alma Hall, who was born on the Wallingford farm now occupied by her son, Col. Henry Hull.  Her father, Reuben Hall, was one of the large land owners and farmers of Wallingford.  Her mother was a Miller, and thus our subject is descended on the maternal side from Benjamin Miller, of Middlefield, one of the first settlers here.  Benjamin Miller had several sons, and our subject's wife, Mrs. Susan A. (Miller) Hull, is descended from one of these on her father's side, and from another on her mother's side.  Through a third son the line descends to our subject.  The families were first united in the marriage of Mr. And Mrs. William Hull, and with the union of Samuel Hull and Susan Miller they are now doubly united.  To Mr. and Mrs. William Hull came four children: (1) Col. Henry married Elnora Humiston.  (2) Elizabeth first married Dr. O. Doolittle, and later Horace Smith.  (3) Samuel is the subject proper of this article.  (4) William Dexter died at the age of seventeen years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deacon Samuel Hull attended the North Farms schools, and also a select school at Meriden.  He remained at home with his parents until he reached the age of twenty years, when he went West to Illinois, then very largely a wilderness.  After spending two years in the West he then came back to his Connecticut home, but soon returned to Illinois, where he engaged in farming.  The poor health of his father very soon called him home again to cultivate the family farm, which passed into his possession after the death of his parents, and for the past fifty years he has been engaged in cultivating this very desirable tract, which has been the home of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.  He was one of the first farmers to engage in tobacco culture.  Mr. Hull is now enjoying the fruits of a long and useful life.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hull was married Jan. 31, 1855, at Middlefield, Conn., to Miss Susan A. Miller, who was born there, daughter of Ira Miller, an old resident of that community.  Mrs. Hull was educated in the public school of Middlefield and in a select school, and was a very capable and successful teacher before her marriage.  To this union have come two children; (1) Alida was educated in the district school, a select school in Meriden, and the State Normal at New Britain, and taught school in Wallingford three terms; she married Horace H. Williams, a dairy farmer, of East Wallingford.  (2) Anna, who was educated at the district school and in the Grammar School at Boston, married Julius Williams, a farmer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deacon Hull is a Republican, but has no thirst for office.  He and his wife belong to the Baptist Church, where for eight years he has officiated as deacon.  They are both highly respected people, and have many warm friends throughout the community.</li>
