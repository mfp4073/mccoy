Mrs. Betsey Judd.  <i>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever.  Eccl. I.4.</i><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Betsey Judd was born in Washington, Conn., on the 28th of August, 1782, the last year of the war of American Independence.  She was one of the eleven children of Seth Hastings, whose ancestry is traced back to 1652.  Among her brothers were Dr. Thomas Hastings, of musical fame, and Orlando Hastings, a lawyer of prominence in New York State.  But one brother remains on earth, Truman Hastings of Cleveland, Ohio.  Seth Hastings moved west to Clinton, N.Y., and here his daughter Betsey married Dr. Elnathan Judd, a descendant of Thomas Judd, who emigrated from England in 1634.  They had children, the late Dr. G.P. Judd, who came to these Islands as a missionary physician in 1827; William P., now deceased; Henry A., now in Michigan; Elizabeth B. (Mrs. A.B. Bates, of San Francisco), and Hattie B., now in Honolulu.  Dr. Elnathan Judd died in 1845, in Troy, Mich., and in 1852 "Grandma Judd," then seventy years of age, accompanied by her daughter Hattie, came to Honolulu, by way of Cape Horn, to make her residence with her son at "Sweet Home."  Here for the past twenty-four years she has lived, surrounded by children, grand-children, and great-grand-children.  It is believed that her direct descendants number over eighty.  She breathed her last on Sabbath evening, May 14th, 1876.  Her death was like her life, peaceful and happy.  She was a woman of rare good sense, cheerful in disposition, and of an affectionate nature.  She loved Christ's kingdom, and in her declining years ceased not to be anxious to learn of its progress on earth.  Her faculties of mind were remarkably well preserved; she expressed in the morning of her last day on earth, her affection and gratitude towards her relatives who were administering to her.  She had enjoyed good health all her days, and even at the last had no disease.  After but three weeks of confinement to her bed, the powers of nature became exhausted, the "silver cord was loosened, the golden bowl was broken," and like a shock of corn fully ripe, she was gathered to her fathers.  She has gone to join that company of friends in heaven who had passed to their rest before her.  Her body was laid in the spot of her own choosing, by the side of her son, in the cemetery near "Sweet Home."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, and His righteousness unto children's children; to such as keep His covenant, and to those that remember His commandments to do them."  Ps CIII. 17, 18.  Honolulu, May 18, 1876.<a href="e3124.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c237.5">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 97.  Betsey Hastings married Dr. Elnathan Judd.  He was born December 3, 1773.  He practiced for many years in Paris Hill, Oneida County, N. Y., but his health having failed, they removed to Clinton.  In 1837 they removed to Troy, Mich., and settled on a farm, where Dr. Judd died, September 4, 1845.  In 1852 Mrs. Judd, with her daughter Harriet, sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where her son, Gerrit P. Judd, had resided for twenty-five years.  The voyage around Cape Horn was a long one for a woman of seventy years, but letters written to home friends prove her to have been an observant traveler, and for twenty-three years she lived a most peaceful life in her son's beautiful home, surrounded by children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.  It is said of her that "she was a woman of rare good sense, cheerful in disposition, and of an affectionate nature."  She had enjoyed good health all her days, and even when the end came at the great age of ninety-four years, she had no disease, and enjoyed the full possession of all her faculties.</li>

<li id="c238.5">[<a href="s3.htm#s134">S134</a>]  <i>Dictionary of American Biography</i>, pages 387 - 388.  Hastings, Thomas (Oct. 15, 1784 - May 15, 1872), hymn-writer and composer, was born at Washington, Litchfield County, Conn., the third of the eleven children of Dr. Seth Hastings, a farmer and physician, and Eunice Parmele.  He was descended from Thomas Hastings of Ipswich, England, who emigrated to Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634 and settled at Watertown.  Thomas removed with his father to Clinton, Oneida County, N.Y.  He developed an early interest in music, but he had little or no opportunity for cultivating it.  Nevertheless, at the age of eighteen he was leading the village choir and in 1806 he began teaching music.  In 1816, with Solomon Warriner, he published <i>Musica Sacra; or Springfield and Utica Collections United</i>, consisting of Psalms, hymn tunes, anthems, and chants.  This book passed through several editions and was reissued as late at 1836.  The original <i>Springfield Collection</i>, a hundred and fifty pages of sacred music from the works of European authors, had been issued by Warriner in 1813; the exact date of the publication by Hastings of the <i>Utica Collection</i>, a much smaller collection, but of original tunes, is not known. That it was compiled for the Handel and Burney Society, under whose patronage it was published, is stated in the introduction to the third edition (1822) of <i>Musica Sacra</i>.  In 1817 Hastings published a <i>Musical Reader</i>, reissued in 1819.  In 1817, also, he removed to Troy.  He went later to Albany, and in 1823 he settled in Utica, where he conducted a religious journal, the <i>Western Recorder</i>, through the columns of which he was able to make known his special views on church music.  During these years at Utica he published <i>The Union Minstrel, for the Use of Sabbath Schools</i> (1830), and with Lowell Mason, <i>Spiritual Songs for Social Worship</i> (1831). In 1832 Hastings was called to New York by a committee from twelve churches, who urged him to come and put into practice in that city the theories for better church music which he had been promulgating. This he did, and for forty years gave himself unreservedly to his important task.  During several years of this period he served as choirmaster in the Bleecker Street Presbyterian Church.  In 1836 he published <i>The Musical Miscellany</i> (2 vols.), and, in collaboration with William Patton, <i>The Christian Psalmist, or Watts Psalms and Hymns</i> (2 vols.), with copious selections from other sources.  Under his own editorship he later published <i>The Manhattan Collection</i> (1837); <i>The Sacred Lyre</i> (1840); and <i>Selah</i> (1856).  With W. B. Bradbury he compiled <i>The Psalmodist</i> (1844), New York Choralist (1847), Mendelssohn Collection (1849), and Psalmista (1851); and with his son, Thomas S. Hastings, <i>Church Melodies</i> (1858). Aside from these musical works he also published <i>Dissertation on Musical Taste</i> (1822, 1853), <i>Devotional Hymns and Religious Poems</i> (1850), <i>History of Forty Choirs</i> (1854), and <i>Sacred Praise</i> (1856).  In 1858 he received the degree of doctor of music from the University of the City of New York, being one of the first in America to receive this degree. It can readily be seen from the list of his published works how faithfully Hastings toiled through the years to carry out the purpose so near his heart.  His work in New York seems to have quite paralleled that of Lowell Mason in New England.  The numerous hymn books published by Hastings were of high rank for their time and successfully carried out the ambition of their author and compiler. Of Hastings' own tunes, of which he is supposed to have written about a thousand, it can be said that next to those of Lowell Mason they were the best of his time in America.  They included "Ortonville," "Rock of Ages" (Toplady), "Retreat," "Sion," and many others.  It is not always possible to identify his hymns for he often published them under assumed names, thinking that the public would have greater respect for the music if the composers' names bore a foreign aspect.  In addition to writing tunes to words, he often wrote words to tunes, thus making possible the use of certain melodies for which there were then no hymns of appropriate meter.  From this beginning he continued until he became one of the acknowledged hymn-writers of the country.  Two of his best-known hymns are "Hail to the Brightness of Zion's Glad Morning," and "He that Goeth Forth with Weeping."  Showing the spirit of the true musical educator and pioneer, he devoted many pages in all of his earlier works to the rudiments of vocal music, comprising the most elementary instruction in notation, scales, and rhythms. Hastings was of unusual appearance as he was an albino and always gave the impression of being old.  He lived long and worked diligently until within a few days of his death.  He was married, Sept. 15, 1822, to Mary Seymour, in Buffalo.  He died in New York City.  His grandson, Thomas Hastings, attained distinction as an architect.<a href="e2049.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e2050.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c238.6">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 21.  THOMAS HASTINGS, MUS. D. by H.  <i>Dear Bro. Hartzler</i>  I have carefully read Prof. Bird's two articles in the New York <i> Independent</i>, concerning the career and writing of the individual above named, to which you recently called my attention, and I beg leave to offer a few thoughts on the same subject, partly by way of correcting some mistakes, and partly in modification of that writer's estimate of the aims and attainments of the individual to whom he alludes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Mr. Hastings was my senior by some fourteen years, we were brought up in the same family, and under similar influences.  At a very early age I became his pupil in musical culture, and afterwards an alternate teacher in several of his schools.  Perhaps there is no person now living who so well understood the processes by which he acquired distinction.  I am not disposed to quarrel with that writer's estimate of the literary or poetic merits of the published hymns of Dr. Hastings.  From that writer's stand-point no higher estimate could be expected.  But in my judgment the Professor has utterly failed to fathom either the definiteness of his aims, the difficulties attending his one pursuit, or the true nature of his actual attainments.  In what I have to say, however, I propose to give my own opinions, <i>as opinions,</i> and not for the purpose of contradiction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I will first correct an error as to dates. The Hastings family did not remove into Oneida County in 1806, but in 1797, when Thomas, the subject of this sketch, was but thirteen years old.  From that time, until his majority, his principal occupation was farm work.  His educational advantages, during that period, were of course extremely limited, yet, as will be seen, they were not neglected.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his early childhood he exhibited an indomitable determination to succeed in whatever he undertook.  When a mere boy he was an inveterate stammerer, and was told to stop and speak slowly.  He at once adopted the practice, when beginning to stammer, of crying out: "Stop, Thomas, speak slow."  This practice he persistently followed, until the habit was entirely conquered.  The boy was, in this respect, father to the man.  This resolute determination to succeed in every undertaking approved by his conscience never left him; and to this fact must be largely attributed his subsequent attainments.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulties which thickly encumbered his early pathway can hardly be appreciated by the present generation.  His extremely defective, and at times deceptive, vision, led to many awkward mishaps, which, to his sensitive nature, were excessively embarrassing, and they often gave rise to ludicrous badinage, not very palatable to one of his temperament.  It also rendered the study of the few books within his reach very laborious and wearisome.  His early developments, therefore, were mostly the result of his own reasoning, not much aided by the thoughts of others.  From boyhood to mature manhood he was proverbially reticent, thoughtful and meditative upon subject foreign to his surroundings.  On one occasion, while working in the harvest-field, his mind became so completely absorbed by something else, that he nearly severed one of his fingers with his sickle.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of his early religious experience little is now known.  He was probably converted at an early age.  But his natural timidity and self-distrust were such as to render him incommunicative upon all subjects of thought and feeling.  His self-distrust, which was undoubtedly principally occasioned by the metaphysical entanglements peculiar to that period, kept him from making a public profession of his faith for many years.  Yet he was ever religiously disposed and tenderly conscientious, seeking, and carefully treading on all occasions the narrow pathway of personal duty.  In his after-life he became more outspoken and less reticent about his religious experiences.  Of his sincere piety and untiring devotion to the cause of Christ he has left most abundant evidence. But it is not of his general Christian character that I desire to speak, and further than to illustrate the motives which governed his final choice of his peculiar vocations, and guided him in his ultimate life work.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hastings had no special training or assistance in his musical studies.  He attended the schools of two successive itinerant teachers of the Psalmody, which was in vogue during the early part of the present century; but neither of them had advanced beyond the limits of the common gamut.  The music of that period was of the rudest character, and illy adapted to devotional purposes. The <i>tunes,</i> as they were then called, with rare exceptions, were light, frivolous, and unmeaning.  It is true that Timothy Olmsted, the latest of those teachers, had begun to feel the need of reform, and had made some local efforts in that direction.  He published a small collection of Psalm tunes from which were excluded some of the worst specimens. Its contents were apparently selected because of their simplicity and indefinable power, and not because of any definite adaptability to a strictly devotional use.  This movement was sufficient, however, to awaken the interest of Mr. Hastings in a right direction, although it failed of effecting any very material change in public sentiment.  It was left for him to inaugurate, and with the ultimate cooperation of such men as Seth Norton, Solomon Warriner, and last, not least, Lowell Mason, to promote a wide-spread and a much needed and radical reformation of the popular taste.  In the process of time it is true that this good work was vigorously supplemented by several other teachers and writers of marked ability.  But the special character of their work is foreign to our present purpose,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr. Hastings was not, in fact, the originator of the reforms in question, he was at least one of the most practical and efficient pioneers.  In his earlier efforts in this direction he was unaided even by books.  Whatever he learned, during that period, concerning the rules of musical composition, or of musical adaptation, was the result of careful and well directed experiments, tested by their effects. Later if life he became a diligent student of the general science, as set forth by the best authors.  Yet he never relinquished the habit of testing every item of his work by its effect upon himself and others.  He early entertained the conviction that the music of the sanctuary was designed to be an efficient handmaid of spiritual devotion, not simply in a loose and general sense, but as a natural and wisely adapted means of intensifying the specific emotions, indicated by the hymns which might be announced as themes for song,<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So long as he entertained these views it ought not to be believed that his musical compositions were either aimless or that they preceded, in point of time, the themes to which he applied them.  He uniformly recognized, and acted upon, the fact that in musical compositions and musical adaptations there are two widely destructive tendencies, to that which is imaginative or secular, and to that which is religious or spiritual.  Nor could he shut his eyes to the fact that these tendencies are directly opposite, if not antagonistic.  Rarely, if ever, did he undertake a musical composition designed for religious use that was not prompted or inspired by the thrilling presence of a strictly devotional theme.  He had little ambition as a mere artist, and he very rarely attempted anything that was distinctively secular.  No man who is skilled in the science of musical adaptation, with this key in his mind, can faithfully study the musical compositions of Mr. Hastings, designed for devotional use, and doubt that in his narrow field he has been preeminently successful.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not less limited was the field he occupied as a hymn writer.  He put forth no claims to a poetic genius like that of a Milton, a Shakespeare, or a Byron, and his writings should not be weighed in their scales.  Neither did he attempt to rival any of the hymn writers, either ancient or modern.  He was too modest for that. In these poetic utterances his heart was the principal factor.  His head had comparatively little to do with them, except in regulating the rhythm and in measuring the syllabic feet.  It was his one great object to furnish to the religious public emotional themes that could be intensified by devoutly impassioned song.  The Churches had been furnished with a multitude of hymns, a large proportion of which may be made deeply impressive by appropriate reading, and yet they are utterly beyond the power of music to add anything to their efficiency.  Most of them were written by individuals unaccustomed to note the loss inflicted upon them when uttered in song. Yet such hymns were, at the time, and still are, in constant use, notwithstanding the fact abundantly proved by experience and observation, that the application of music thereto ordinarily renders them absolutely powerless.  The influence of this practice upon the music of our Churches is obvious.  It is little more than a pleasing interlude, relieving the worshipers from the weariness of consecutive thought.  Artistic display, to a great extent, has usurped the place of that which was designed to be strictly devotional.  It was therefore the chosen life-work of Mr. Hastings, by his teachings and writings, whether hymnal or musical, to relieve the Churches, as far as possible, from the incubus of artistic display, by the introduction of only so much of art as is consistent with true devotion.  This he hoped to accomplish by the exhibition of a more effective style in both departments.  No man can thoroughly appreciate either the music or the hymns composed by Mr. Hastings who fails to understand the aims, or to sympathize with the devotional spirit, which inspired them.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of his hymns, and much of his music, contain internal evidence of the well known fact that they were called forth by special circumstances.  No one who thoughtfully reads the hymn beginning with the line "In this calm, impressive hour," in connection with the music originally written for it, can doubt that the inspiration of both was gathered at some peculiarly quiet season of evening devotion.  In like manner the prayer for help, in the hymn, "Gently, Lord, oh gently lead us," suggests its origin in a season of quiet and submissive suffering.  The tender and earnest appeal, beginning with the lines, "Return, O wanderer, to thy home, Thy Father calls for thee," was undoubtedly prompted by some facts in the career of an acquaintance for whom the writer felt a deep spiritual interest, and the music to which he afterwards applied it was admirable calculated to intensity its power as an appeal to sinners of all classes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Very few of his best musical conceptions were exclusively appropriated to themes of his own composition.  He often adopted the themes of others and composed music for them.  These selections, and the musical conceptions which followed, were sometimes prompted by some startling event, which strongly excited his sympathies.  An event of that kind, not now distinctly remembered, led to his adoption of that favorite hymn of Montgomery, beginning with the lines, "Friend after friend departs, Who hath not lost a friend?" and to the off hand composition for it, of music, which has rarely been equaled for simplicity and power.  He afterwards tried to give this hymn a more elaborate setting.  But in the absence of the originating inspiration it became a comparative failure.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On another occasion, while hastening to the bedside of his absent wife, who had suddenly been seized by a disease supposed to be fatal, he became nearly prostrated by the thought that they should never meet again on earth, and, although he was on board of a crowed, noisy steamer, he retired to some quiet nook where he could without disturbance indulge his grief.  In that sad hour he composed a kind of musical monody to the words, "Farewell! we meet no more On this side of heaven," embodying more of true Christian pathos than can be found in any other composition that was come to the knowledge of the present writer. The hymn, "She has gone to her grave in peace; She sleeps with the pious dead," and the music designed for its enforcement, were written upon receiving intelligence of the death of his daughter, Mrs. Catharine Scudder, a missionary in India.  They both breathe the very soul of Christian submission and triumphant hope.  But enough.  Mr. Hastings' hymns were made to be sung, and if the science of musical adaptation is ever placed upon a proper footing in our Churches, they will rank much higher than very many that now esteemed of superior grade.</li>

In 1796 the family removed to Clinton, N.Y., and there young Hastings worked on his father's farm and attended the district school.  His love for music was already marked, and he now began to study the rudiments, aided by a little four-page gamut-book.  At the age of eighteen he attained to the coveted position of leader of the village choir, and became possessor of an elaborate treatise on music, presented by his brother, which he mastered unaided.  In 1806 he was invited to take charge of a singing school and soon after undertook the training of church choirs, showing peculiar fitness for the work and becoming widely known.  In 1822 he went to Troy to teach singing, then to Albany and other places, and about that time compiled "Musica Sacra," a collection of church-tunes, and wrote a "Dissertation on Musical Taste" (1822; 2d. Ed., 1833, revised and republished in 1853).  "Musica Sacra," published in 1816, passed through ten editions.  In 1823 he removed to Utica, N.Y., where for nine years he edited the "Western Recorder," a religious weekly, in whose columns he was free to express his opinions regarding church music and to advocate reforms in the manner of rendering it.  During this period he often lectured in Albany, New York city, Philadelphia and Princeton, N.J., imparting his enthusiasm on his favorite subject to his hearers.  In 1832 he settled in New York city, and remained a resident until his death.  For many years he was choir-master of the Bleecker Street Presbyterian Church.  He contributed frequently to the religious newspapers, and in 1835 began the publication of the "Musical Magazine," which had a brief life of two years.  The important part he had taken in elevating the standard of church-music in this country, and in educating the public taste, was recognized by the University of New York, which in 1858 conferred upon him the degree of Mus.

Thomas S. Hastings; "Hastings Church Music" (1860); and "Introits" (1865).  Dr. Hastings wrote many hymns, of which about 200 have been published in this country and in England.  He left over 600 hymns in manuscript.  Out of a prize list of 50 hymns by American authors, which was made by popular vote six were by Dr. Hastings, and their first lines are, "Gently Lord, O gently lead us," "Hail to the brightness," "How calm and beautiful the morn," "He that goeth forth and weepeth," "Delay not, delay not, O sinner," and "Today the Saviour calls."  He was married to Mary Seymour, and was the father of Thomas Samuel Hastings, of the Union Theological Seminary.  He died in New York city, May 15, 1872.</li>

A few days of illness, in which he suffered little bodily pain, closed his long and well-spent life in the eighty-eighth year of his age.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A writer in <i>The Evangelist</i> thus describes Thomas Hastings, the man:  "I knew him in the late '50s as a Christian layman.  He was at that time leading the choir of Dr. Hutton's Church, on Washington Square, New York, and teaching a Bible class of young men in the Sunday school.  Mr. Hastings' tall form and face, almost buried in his Bible, eyes closely guarded with double glasses, his earnest manner, clear and forcible teaching, are vividly recalled.  He was then engaged on the early books of the Old Testament, tracing in the Tabernacle worship the foreshadowing of Christ.  In his teaching everything led up to Him, no matter what book of the collections he might have in hand.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was natural, when I began to think seriously of the religious life, that I should seek his counsel, and I shall never forget the evening spent in his Amity Street home (so well-known to many of the arriving and departing missionaries of those days), and the fatherly way in which he received me, and his plain and simple exposition of the meaning of faith.  A few years before his death, during a summer visit to relatives in Geneva, N. Y., I found him still the same; even his physical vigor remained, for he would run up stairs like a boy, and did, I believe, almost to the last.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In after years, during winter visits to New York, I several times saw Mrs. Hastings at the house of her son, and noted the deep yet unaffected piety which had characterized her husband.  Religion was a very real thing to her, and was carried into every event of life, no matter how trivial.  Such saints as these are to be cherished in our memories, and should be inspirers of our lives."</li>

He early left home to pursue his studies at the Academy in Cherry Valley, and he afterward studied law in Clinton, and in 1818 he began the practice of his profession in Geneseo, N. Y.  After some years spent there he removed to Rochester in 1830, and for many years was one of the leading lawyers of western New York.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The striking characteristic of his mind was clearness and quickness of perception and soundness of judgment.  He readily received and marshaled the facts of the case before him, and applied with just discrimination the principles of law applicable to them.  Hence he was a safe counselor.  He was also an able advocate.  He possessed the faculty of presenting the arguments which had convinced himself of the truth and justice of his cause, so clearly and simply, and yet so forcibly to the court and jury, as generally to convince them.  He was always heard with pleasure, for his address was characterized by strong, good sense.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He never undertook the management of a case if he thought the person who sought to engage him was not actuated by proper motives, and he never refused to undertake a case because the person who sought his assistance was poor and unable to pay him.  He went about everywhere with an open heart and open hand, and displayed the same liberality in his calling at the law as he showed to the poor in his daily walks.  Hundreds and thousands, who had nothing to pay, have gone to him and found advice and help in every spices of difficulty.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For tenderness of sympathy Mr. Hastings was one of the thousand, and I have never known a heart more susceptible to kindness or more easily moved with sympathy for the wants and woes of others.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His was a life rendered beautiful and holy by the daily observance of every Christian virtue, and he loved the interests of the church as his own life.</li>
<li id="c240.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s565">S565</a>] Source not known, He married Betsey Clark 1st. He married Mrs. Lydia F. Hamilton 2nd. He was at first a merchant of Clinton, afterwards a lawyer of Genesee, then in Rochester.</li>
