The Millionaire Dies After a Brief Struggle--His Life The Story of a Self-Made Man.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rochester, N.Y.  July 12.-- Hiram Sibley, Rochester's wealthiest and probably most widely-known citizen, died at 10:30 o'clock this morning after an illness of only five days, at the age of 81 years.  Up to last Sunday Mr. Sibley had enjoyed as good health as often falls to the lot of one so advanced in years.  On Sunday night he was stricken with apoplexy.  His family physician, Dr. T.C. White, was immediately summoned and found his aged patient in a very precarious condition.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At 2 o'clock on Monday afternoon Mr. Sibley became unconscious and remained so on Monday and Tuesday, his death being momentarily expected.  Tuesday night he rallied somewhat and experienced several lucid intervals during that night and on Wednesday, but the improvement was only temporary.  This morning at an early hour he was visibly sinking, and he expired at the time mentioned.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The greatest interest has been manifested by Mr. Sibley's townsmen in his illness, every particle of information concerning it being eagerly discussed.  The plans for the funeral have not yet been made public.  No accurate estimate of the vast wealth Mr. Sibley leaves is obtainable.  His fortune has been variously at from $6,000,000 to $10,000,000.  Besides his vast investment in the seed business here, he is known to have owned several valuable properties in New-York City, Buffalo, and elsewhere.  Mr. Sibley leaves, besides his wife, one son, Hiram W. Sibley, and one daughter, Mrs. I. S. Averell, residents of this city.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hiram Sibley was a typical self-made man.  He started without a dollar, and by hard work and dauntless energy he brought everything that he undertook to a successful issue.  Various enterprises engaged his attention, and for many years he occupied a large place in the public gaze.  Of late, although not so widely known as formerly, he has presented the spectacle of a man long past threescore and ten directing large and varied interests with the vigor of one of half his years, and keeping his mind in constant and active use upon a multitude of matters which only a strong, clear head could master.  He died in harness.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;North Adams, Mass., was the home of the Sibleys, and there on Feb. 6, 1807, Hiram Sibley was born.  His parents were of American birth, descended from English stock.  They were sturdy, honest people, but too poor to give their children more than a usual country schooling.  While yet a lad the subject of this sketch was apprenticed to a shoemaker.  He did not like that trade, and at the age of 17 he went to Lima, in this State, where he entered a cotton factory.  In the following year he was a wool carder in the shop in which Millard Fillmore then worked.  At 21 he started a machine shop at the place now called Sibleyville, in Monroe County.  At the end of 10 years he had built up such a large business that some one else wanted it enough to offer Mr. Sibley's price for it.  With money in his pocket and considerable experience he moved to Rochester, where he always afterward had his home.  He there entered the banking and real estate business and became so well known and popular that at the end of five years he was elected Sheriff of Monroe County.  That was the only public office he ever held.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1850, when he had made a reputation as a sagacious business man, he was approached with a proposition that he aid in the organization of a telegraph company under the House patents.  Finally he bought the patents, and in April, 1851, he organized the New-York and Mississippi Valley Telegraph Printing Company.  Before the end of that year he built 100 miles of line.  He learned in the next two or three years that there were too many companies in the field for any of them to make much money.  About $7,000,000 had been invested in 20 companies.  In 1854, at about the time that his company leased the lines of the Lake Erie Company, he met Ezra Cornell, who had valuable grants under the Morse patent and who also controlled the Erie and Michigan Company.  They agreed to buy in the small companies, whose stockholders were glad to save anything and to join forces in a large company.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus was born the Western Union Telegraph Company, which was chartered by the Legislatures of Wisconsin and New-York in the Spring of 1856.  Mr. Sibley was its first President, and held that position until 1866, when his health failed and he retired for a long rest.  In 1869 he resigned the Vice-Presidency to which he was elected when he relinquished the higher office, and withdrew from the company.  From the beginning of his management the Western Union Company flourished.  He perfected the system until it covered practically the country east of the Mississippi, and then looked for new fields.  It occurred to him that a line might be extended to the Pacific.  When he broached the subject to his fellow-Directors it met with a cold reception.  Mr. Sibley said:  "Gentlemen, if you won't join hands with me in this thing, I'll go it alone."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1860 Mr. Sibley went to Washington with his transcontinental project.  Howell Cobb, Secretary of the Treasury, became interested in it.  In June of that year Congress passed an act granting an annual subsidy for 10 years at $40,000, and Secretary Cobb officially accepted Mr. Sibley's offer to construct the lines.  Salmon P. Chase signed a similar authorization when he became Secretary of the Treasury.  Work had hardly got well started when the Overland Telegraph Company was organized in San Francisco.  The Sibley and Overland interests were soon united under the name of the Pacific Telegraph Company, and in less than five months after July, 1861, when ground for this enterprise was broken, announcement was made that telegraphic communication from ocean to ocean was at the service of the public.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new line and Western Union were amalgamated in March, 1864.  Mr. Sibley next proposed to establish telegraphic communication with Europe by way of Asia, and to reach Asia by a line across Behring Strait.  He negotiated concessions from the Russian Government, and wires were actually strung in Siberia as well as in Alaska when the Atlantic cable was laid.  That ended this great undertaking.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After retiring from the Western Union Company in 1869 Mr. Sibley went back to Rochester and started an extensive seed and nursery business.  He was at that time 62 years old and rich, and he had a large interest in the management of railroads in the South and West, sufficient to occupy the attention of an ordinary man at that age.  But he had no idea of slackening his pace.  He bought a 40,000-acre farm in Illinois, 4,000 acres in Cayuga County, and about a dozen farms elsewhere in this State; also some 13,000 acres of timber land, mainly in Michigan.  The farms supplied the material for his seed business, which he conducted in this city, in Rochester, and in Chicago.  He bought the timber land for a lumber trade.  He also had an interest in salt mines, and kept himself posted on his railroad properties.  The Directors of the Bank of Monroe, in Rochester, elected him President of that bank, and he found time to attend to the duties of that office.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of the absorbing nature of his business Mr. Sibley was public spirited and spent large sums of money in philanthropic and charitable objects.  Through his friendship for Ezra Cornell he was named in the act of incorporation one of the Trustees of Cornell University.  Thereupon he founded the Sibley College of Mechanical Arts at Cornell, on which he spent at different times $150,000.  He built and presented Sibley Hall to the University of Rochester, spending $120,000 on it.  The building is used for the university library and cabinet.  He was for years a generous patron of the Rochester Industrial School.  A twenty-six-thousand-dollar church at North Adams was presented by him to his native town.  The Rochester hospitals and charitable institutions were always helped by him, at least $100,000 having been given in that direction.  Many private charities that will never be published were also bestowed by him.<a href="e4273.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Early Dark Days - Rochester as a Nursing Mother - Rochester men Members of the First Telegraph company and Builders of the First Transcontinental Line - Rise and Fall of the Russian Project.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That Rochester, New York, before any other city in the United States nourished and stimulated the magnetic telegraph in the days of its neglected infancy, saving it from failure and complete disaster, is a fact unknown save to the students of telegraphy.  The story of Rochester's early interest in the inventions of Morse, House, and Bain, but particularly that of Professor Morse, is told in the names alone of her citizens who became identified with the enterprise, and who have done much to make it what it is.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was in one of those "four very dark years before 1843," as Professor Morse used to call them, that we first hear of Rochester in telegraphy.  Professor Morse had finally compassed the difficulty of raising money sufficient to go to Washington in person with his invention.  Not long before making that venture we find him writing to his partner, F.O.J. Smith, "I have not a cent in the world....  I am too poor to risk the trifling expense which my journey and residence in Washington will occasion me."  The spring of 1841 found him in Washington, desperately laboring with the Committee which was to present to Congress his appeal for means to erect an experimental line to prove the value of the magnetic telegraph.  The inferior inventions of his rivals had been taken up and heralded on every side.  His idea - the idea of his invention - was abroad in the world.  He had secured a patent in France, and the unqualified approval of the same from the French Institute, where it had been exhibited and admired by men of science.  England, surlily claiming a better invention in that of Wheatstone and Cooke, had not prevented her distinguished men from honoring Morse and promising their assistance in an appeal in his behalf to Parliament.  The President of the United States and the Cabinet had witnessed an exhibition of the instrument, and had expressed their interest and gratification, but there was an open distrust of its practicability, and the idea of appropriating $40,000 for experimenting with it seemed folly.  Morse, in his determination to get an appropriation from the Government if possible, left no stone unturned.  Even his good friends in Washington were depressed by his persistence in swimming against the current.  "Give it up; go home; think no more about it," said Fernando Wood; and there were others to tell him that he might just as sensibly as for an appropriation for Millerism or mesmerism.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And here we find the beginning of the story of Rochester in telegraphy.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"No.  I did not go to Washington on purpose to help Morse get his appropriation," says Hiram Sibley when led to discourse upon this page in his history.  "That is the way the story is usually told, I know.  I went to Washington to see Harrison inaugurated.  I don't remember that I was interested in magnetic telegraph particularly until a lady who was staying at the hotel came to me and urged my assisting Professor Morse in getting a favorable hearing before the Committee, which she feared would turn the cold shoulder to him at last.  No, I do not remember the lady's name, but she succeeded in interesting me in Morse, and I started out to find the Chairman of that Committee, and to do my best with him.  Joshua R. Giddings said he would introduce me, and we were going to the committee-room when he was called to go down to the floor of the House.  I had heard that the Chairman looked like Rochester's old citizen, Thomas Kempshall.  I sat waiting for Mr. Giddings, when I saw a gentleman leave a committee-room, and he did look like Tom Kempshall, sure enough.  So I stepped forward and put out my hand.  "'Good morning, Kempshall.  Is that you?'  "'And who is Kempshall?' was the genial response.  'This is the third time within a few days that I have been called by his name.'"<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hiram Sibley never planned a better opening for what promised to be a frosty interview; and he had the tact to postpone introducing his subject until Mr. Kempshall's double was in precisely the humor he desired.  Thereupon a plea for Morse was presented.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And you really think there is something in his invention, do you?  Well, then, keep him away from the committee-room or he'll upset everything.  Why!  he undertook to prove to us that he could send ten words from Washington to Baltimore <i>in two minutes and a half!</i>  Good heavens!  If he had said ten, we might have thought him sane."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I didn't wonder at their incredulity," says Mr. Sibley, in telling the story, "but I said nothing about my own doubts, and defended the invention.  What was an appropriation of $40,000 by a Government like ours for testing an invention which, if all its inventor professed, was priceless to civilization - the stupendous discovery of the age?"<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result was the passing of the bill (1843) appropriating $40,000 to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury for testing the merits of the invention of Professor Morse.  The ridicule expended upon the bill in Congress, the coldness of the Senate, the penniless inventor leaving the gallery in despair before the vote was taken - all this reveals the extent of Mr. Sibley's achievement - perhaps we should add with the assistance of Thomas Kempshall.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the operation of the experimental telegraph between Washington and Baltimore was not such as to temp the Government to pay $100,000 for the Morse patent, and to become the exclusive owner of the invention.  Nor would the Government make further investment in the enterprise.  New York capitalists refused the risk decidedly, as did those of all the seaboard cities.  The $15,000 necessary for building the line from Fort Lee to Philadelphia was not easily raised, the money coming from almost as many localities as there were hundreds of dollars.  Rochester was the first city which by a strong association of its leading business men - not its capitalists - furnished the means for a line.  The contract for that line was taken (June, 1845) by Henry O'Reilly for the extension of the Morse telegraph over a region of territory wider and more valuable than any which had then been contemplated under a single assignment.  He proposed to connect the seaboard line at Philadelphia with Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and all the principal towns of the West.  As necessary capital for his grand scheme was his only limitation, according to his own interpretation of his litigation-breeding contract, he called together his fellow-citizens, laid his plans before them, and the Atlantic, Lake and Mississippi Valley Telegraph Company was organized, the names of its [   ].<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The members of this original compact were:  Jonathan Childs, Samuel L. Selden, Henry R. Selden, Elisha D. Ely, Hugh T. Brooks, Micah Brooks, John S. Skinner, Hervey Ely, Alvah Strong, George Dawson.  Henry R. Selden, President; George Dawson, Treasurer; Henry O'Reilly, Secretary.  James D. Reid and Anson Stager, the former a bookkeeper and the latter a "devil" in the <i>Democrat</i> office, joined Mr. O'Reilly in the organization of the work.  The story of the building of this early line is amusingly told by James D. Reid in his History of Telegraphy.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Contemporaneous with this telegraphic enterprise was another with Rochester for its centre, or one of its centres, if Utica question such monopoly of the honor.  The New York, Albany, and Buffalo Electric Magnetic Telegraphic Company was canvassing the state for subscriptions.  Of the thirty subscribers secured for the line, whose first section was between Albany and Utica, seven were from Rochester, seven from Utica, one from New York, five from Buffalo, and the rest from Syracuse, Auburn, Ithaca, and Little Falls.  This company, from the time of its organization (1846) to that of its absorption into the Western Union (1864), was characterized by vigorous and intelligent management.  Professor Morse for many years relied solely upon its earning for his support.  In 1847 it gave him an income of $3,083.50.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be hard telling who first thought of a telegraph to the Pacific Coast.  It was in the order of things that such a project should be thought of, at least in California.  The carrying out of the enterprise was another thing.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Henry O'Reilly (1857) contemplated undertaking the building of a line to the Pacific Coast before the first stage had crossed the plains.  In 1857 we find Hiram Sibley urging the Board of the Western Union in Rochester to undertake a California line.  "Who but Sibley would dream of such a thing?  A likely story that the Indians would not cut down the poles - even if poles could be provided without ruinous cost.  No, it won't pay.  There is too much uninhabited country out there.  Better wait until a railroad has been built."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was the conservatism of success.  One of Hiram Sibley's "crazy schemes" had made the fortune of those men who questioned if embarking in another might not prove their ruin.  The Western Union would have nothing to do with the project - at the outset - nor would the North American Telegraph Association.  Neither would any of the members of either company risk a single dollar.  "Very well, gentlemen," said Mr. Sibley, "if you won't join hands with me I'll go it alone."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He went to Washington, secured a hearing and the passage of a bill on June 16, 1860, "to facilitate communication between the Atlantic and Pacific States by electric telegraph."  The articles of agreement between S.P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, with Hiram Sibley (November, 1861), is an interesting document, and but for its length would be presented here.  Mr. Sibley alone contracted for the building of the whole line, to be completed within two years, the Government to have preference in use of the same, and to pay a subsidy of $40,000 a year for ten years; should the business transmitted for the Government at ordinary rates exceed the amount of the subsidy, the excess was to be submitted to Congress, the contract containing no provision for the payment of any additional sum by the Department.  Mr. Sibley sublet the building of the section between San Francisco and Salt Lake to the California State Telegraph Company, and after the completion of the whole line, the Western Union assumed the project, organizing the Pacific Telegraph Company, composed mainly of Rochester men, to operate that line and the lines it had acquired on the Pacific Coast, through contract of Mr. Sibley with the California State Telegraph Company.  The six bondsmen on Mr. Sibley's proposal to build the line were all Rochester men.  Of the eight bondsmen on the contract after the completion of the line six were of Rochester.  Western Union was immensely benefitted by this enterprise, which as completed in four months and eleven days.  It was the most profitable line ever known, and was considered by some a providential preparation for the War of the Rebellion.  It was completed ten years in advance of the railroad, and Indians, instead of cutting down the poles as had been prophesied, were sending presents to Hiram Sibley - skins and [  ]me, live deer and antelope.  A black-tailed buck, gift of White Cloud, died but a few years ago, of old age, in his new home in Rochester.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The expense of the Government business largely exceeded the subsidy of $40,000 a year.  When the contract expired the Western Union found the Government its debtor to the amount of $91,000, which it relinquished, a gift to the nation to be remembered of the great monopoly.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was reasonable that Perry McD. Collins, with his idea of an overland line to telegraph via Behrings Strait and Asiatic Russia to Europe, should submit that idea to the projector of the Western Union and the Pacific Telegraph, and that Mr. Sibley's approval of the undertaking was given with his characteristic decision.  In October, 1861, we find him replying to Mr. Collins: "If I had the money, I would go on and complete the line, and talk about it afterward."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was in Rochester that Mr. Collins submitted his plan to the Western Union, which resulted in his transferring to the company his rights and privileges in the Russian telegraph under certain valuable grants.  Then Mr. Sibley and Mr. Collins went to Russia, and were received with consideration by the Czar, who entered into the project with enthusiasm.  The <i>Great Eastern</i> at the time was taking into her immense hold, at the docks of an English harbor, the coils of cable which the confident investors in Russian stock prophesied would be lost in the bottom of the Atlantic.  Better 16,000 miles of land line than 2,000 at such risk.  Across unexplored and unmapped wilderness the "Russian" wires were rapidly stretched, the heroism of surveyors and workmen equaled only by the satisfaction of the possessors of "Russian" stock, who never doubted but that the "submarine" would be a failure.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Western Union lost $3,000,000 in the Russian project.  The first message by Atlantic cable was its death blow.  "It footed the bill," says Reid, "without a shiver and without reducing the market value of the stock."  The official correspondence of the undertaking, particularly the letters of the Secretary, Judge O.H. Palmer, of Rochester, would be a priceless contribution to the literature of telegraphy.<a href="e3179.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e3180.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Rochester in Western Union - Rise of that Great Corporation - Need of Telegraph Federation - Personal Details - Mr. Sibley on "A Line Forage" - The Results.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There have been four eras in the history of telegraphy:  First, the era of the study of the phenomena of electricity.  Second, the era of invention - of Morse, Wheatstone, and House, and Daniell, without whose invention that of Morse would have failed.  Third, the era of enthusiasm - of men like Henry O'Reilly and Ezra Cornell, overcoming difficulties they had not assailed could they have measured them in advance.  Fourth, the era of administration - of the saviors of the invention, the men, and conspicuously the man, who, harmonizing the antagonisms resulting from the invention, brought order out of chaos and saved to civilization its grandest discovery.  Morse planted the vine that ran wild in its riotous strength.  Hiram Sibley, with his idea which have the impulse to the evolution of the Western Union, pruned and trained until the story of its fabulous vintage surpasses the tale of Aladdin's lamp.  "I have made a study of the financial successes of the world," said A.T. Stewart to Mr. Sibley, "and there was never anything like what came of the Western Union."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crisis of telegraphy had come, and its future seemed most unpromising.  Plunk and enterprise, of which there had been no lack, were not sufficient for the trouble, unless made secondary to a strong controlling will, and infallible insight - the genius of monopoly, in short - to organize a rabble of conflicting interests into one federation.  The Morse lines, Bain lines, House lines, O'Reilly lines, with their endless litigations over infringements of patents and broken contracts, local jealousies, disastrous competitions, unequal and capricious tariffs, had made telegraphy a bad investment.  Out of the thirty or forty companies only two or three were self-sustaining prior to 1855.  Unity of action, necessary to the despatch of messages, was impossible.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea of the federation which resulted in the Western Union (1854) was that of Hiram Sibley, and it was projected by him almost alone.  The original company of seventeen stockholders, subsequently increased to twenty, subscribing about $5,000 each, was organized in Rochester and composed almost entirely of Rochester men.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That the magnetic telegraph was neither a financial nor a mechanical success until the conflicting companies were consolidated into a federation or harmonious union is an undisputed fact of history, and so also that Hiram Sibley, of Rochester, was the original projector of the idea, which in its embryonic state was called "Sibley's crazy scheme," even by men who reluctantly invested in its furtherance, and who lived to see their expectation of failure banished by fabulous success.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It did seem like a crazy scheme - the buying up of broken-down telegraph companies, accumulating their worthless stocks, assuming their liabilities, etc.  It was no secret that Hiram Sibley had mortgaged everything and borrowed heavily in his determination to carry out his project.  Possibly he did not relish being called a "line gobbler," but ridicule mattered little to him if the necessary capital for buying up companies and the controlling interests of patents could be secured.  Again and again he had called the capitalists of Rochester together and presented to them with a directness of appeal they found it hard to answer, his plan for saving telegraphy and making it enormously profitable.  "If I do invest on it, Sibley." said one, whose conversion to "Western Union" he was laboring for, as they walked home alone together after one of those meetings, when no one had been courageous enough to do more than listen to all that was said, "promise me it shall be a secret between us forever.  I'll loan you $5,000 - that means, give it to you, for you'll lose it, of course - but you are never to tell that I was such a fool.  I believe in you, Sib, but I don't believe in this telegraphy."  The check advanced upon those conditions was the germ of a princely fortune.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sibley was becoming disgusted with Rochester capitalists.  They would attend the meetings in his office, but when it came to signing their names for $5,000 worth of stock, he might as well have asked them to lend a hand in digging a well in the air.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I will give them one more chance," he said.  "it shall be the last call"; and one evening some twenty-five Rochester men assembled in Mr. Sibley's office in the Arcade.  No doubt a good majority of them accepted the invitation vowing they would not be enticed into embarking upon what they considered a very leaky boat.  They knew how Sibley could talk when he was in dead earnest, and the powerful magnetism of the man.  Telegraphy was unlucky.  "Have nothing to do with the unlucky," said the cautious Rochester man.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The photographer who had uncovered his camera upon that group had made a good investment in Western Union.  There was Sibley, in the vigor of his days, his penetrating eye forecasting in each face the result of the meeting.  There were Isaac R. Elwood, Isaac Butts, Joseph Medbury, H.S. Potter, G.H. Mumford, Addison Gardiner, Samuel L. Selden, E.P. Willis, Don Alonzo Watson, G.S. Burbank, J.B. Stetson, Aristarchus Champion, and W.H. Cheney, men who fortune was regarding with exceptional favor upon that occasion - placing with their reach a marvelous opportunity.  But how were they to know that she was about to turn her wheel upward with such rapidity; that her wand was nothing more than the page of legal cap waiting their signatures upon Mr. Sibley's table?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From addressing them collectively Mr. Sibley appealed to each in turn.  Would they subscribe $5,000 each that evening, the ultimate test of their faith in the project?  He should leave the city the next day, for there was no time to be lost in securing certain property necessary for the basis of the organization.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thereupon Aristarchus Champion, the prudent millionaire, found tongue to say:  "You admit, Mr. Sibley, that the telegraph is a failure?"  "I do," was the empathic response.  "And you further admit that each company is a failure - that in particulars and generals the whole thing is a failure?"  "I do."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Then how is this consolidation of failures to escape failure?  If there is nothing in the result which is not in the cause, where is the element of success to come in?  Would collecting all the paupers - the social failures of Monroe County - into one organization, composed entirely of paupers, insure their success and make them men of fortune?"<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Isaac Butts must have taken a heavy pinch of snuff upon that, and the undecided must have felt that Aristarchus Champion was a wise logician.  But conviction in this case with Sibley was stronger than syllogism.  Would Mr. Champion sign the paper?  Mr. Champion would not.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Admitting all that you have said, Mr. Sibley," said Judge Gardiner, serenely - "admitting that this organization by the investment proposed may reap a certain and increasing success, is it at all probable that you or I, or any here present, will live long enough to see your prophecy fulfilled, to reap the benefit of faith in your seer-ship?"<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither would Mr. Sibley discuss the question from that outlook.  There was the paper.  Would Judge Gardiner sign it?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The name of Addison Gardiner was the first on the list.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George H. Mumford sat for awhile twirling his thumbs when appealed to individually by Mr. Sibley.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It looks to me like a nest of boxes," he said at last.  "We must open a great many before coming to the one that holds the promised treasure, and we may find nothing after all.  We must buy up line after line - the purchase of each the sequence of a preceding purchase."  Then he thought awhile in silence, and signed his name.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I agree with Mr. Champion," said Gideon Burbank, and J.B. Stetson testified the same, and W.H. Cheney.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Things looked serious," says Mr. Sibley, in describing the meeting, "and I began to think my cake was dough after all."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Don Alonzo knit his brows.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'll tell you in the morning.  Perhaps I'll take all I can pay for."  He did advance $5,000, but not because he believed he should not lose it in the end.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The ninety thousand dollars subscribed at that meeting," says Mr. Sibley, "was all the money that was ever paid.  The balance was money loaned on bonds of the company, and individual loans.  Isaac Butts promised the other ten and paid it in stock of other lines.  That one hundred thousand dollars, with what was gained by the consolidation with the House Lines outside of the State of New York, constituted the property of the Western Union Telegraph Company, and soon exceeded in value the whole assessed value of the property real and personal of the city of Rochester.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As fast as we could make a line pay 7 per cent, we put it in.  The increase was in making worthless property valuable.  The original stockholders, the signers for $5,000, could not have escaped becoming millionaires if they had held on to their stock.  Hiram Sibley, H.S. Potter, Joseph Medbury, and Don Alonzo Watson alone retained their original shares, besides buying up from others."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story of how Mr. Sibley bought up the stock of several heavy holders, paying par for it and so confirming the belief of many that he was insane, is familiar to Rochester bankers.  Even Samuel L. Selden caught the fever of selling out, and would have cleared himself of Western Union stock, but Sibley's regard for the man left one-half of his shares upon his hands.  One large holder of shares whom Mr. Sibley consented to buy out, and that at better terms than he expected straightaway called in many witnesses to hear [   ] viz: That Hiram Sibley was willing to take not only his stock off his hands, but that of several others in whose salvation from ruin the seller was interested.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mental anxiety endured by some of those early stockholders was pathetically expressed in their letters to Mr. Sibley at the time, begging him to sell their shares for what they would bring.  "If nothing I can say will touch your heart," wrote one of the subsequent magnates of Western Union, "have pity upon my wife and my children."  Mr. Sibley's answer to that letter, the terse reiteration of his confidence in Western Union, and what his "pity" for the wife and the children plainly dictated. was characteristic of the man, who although finding nothing exhilarating in the early monthly balance-sheets of the company, knew to a certainty what the future had in store.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those were the days when Sibley is said to have gone up and down the land, "grip-sack" in hand, on "a line forage" - that is, buying up telegraph stock at nominal prices.  Within forty-three days he acquired the majority of the stock necessary for operations.  As Trustee with Samuel L. Selden, of the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company (House Patent) a consolidation of that company had been effected with the Erie and Michigan (Morse Patent) in 1856, under the title of the Western Union.  The idea of the Western Union was the federation of the telegraphic interest of the country.  The depression in telegraph stock made acquisition of it an easy matter comparatively, to one acquainted with the financial embarrassments of the different companies.  Mr. Gisley gave his time for more than three years to buying up the stock of the different corporations - some of it as low as two cents on a dollar - and in consolidating the lines of thirteen States.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was but one ending to the majority of telegraph companies after the consolidation of the Western Union.  Sooner or later they were merged under the administration - which made the existence of rivals almost impossible.  The stock bought for a song became valuable in the hands of the new corporation.  The capital of one perishing company - for illustration - valued at $240,000, was easily bought by Mr. Sibley at less than two cents on a dollar.  What was adjudged to Ezra Cornell - who gave the Western Union its name - as worth about $50,000 in 1857, required the issue to him of nearly $2,000,000 of Western Union stock in 1865.  The price paid for "the O'Reilly lines" was the cost of running them for one year.  If Fortune was a little slow in turning her wheel for the anxious projectors of the Western Union, sometimes tantalizing them with a pretense of a downward movement, so suddenly did they find themselves at the apex of success at last, it is said that the Secretary of the company was fairly confounded by the incoming overwhelming tide and almost doubted his ability to read figures, if not his own sanity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For sixteen years from the time of its organization Hiram Sibley, as President or Vice-President, was the directing spirit of the Western Union.  His co-workers were mainly Rochester men.  The headquarters of the company was not removed to New York until 1865, the year following the memorable excitement resulting from the declared dividend of the company, December 23, 1863 , when the stock rose to 225, and the holder of the most minute quantity was believed to be a second Aladdin.  The golden possibilities of Western Union, the "crazy scheme" they had so reluctantly endorsed, made millionaires of the original stockholders.  "Stocks went up," it was said, "with every smile on Sibley's face."  It was at this time that, as Reid tells the story, "pianos, guitars, furniture, mortgages, and homesteads were converted into Western Union stock, and while the public mind was thus excited the Board declared a dividend of 100 per cent., increasing the capital to $21,063,400.  It was clear and unmixed water.  This dividend after a few years seriously endangered the stability of the company, and rendered its administration obnoxious and perilous."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It was a red-letter day in Rochester," says Reid.  "The duplicated stock was carried home by its happy recipients, and locked up...with a smile of exultation, as if the battle of life had been fought and won."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But the added millions," says Reid, "became a millstone, the full weight and drag of which was not felt for years.  It was realized when leading telegraph companies came to form with the Western Union a great compacted company.  To settle the representation of capital on a just basis, many millions of stock in excess of what would have been necessary had that hundred per cent. dividend not been declared had to be issued.  The water in the capital of one company had to be equaled with water in all the rest.  Instead of an easily handled capital of at most $25,000,000, a swiftly coming era of shrinkage and broken values had to be confronted with one of $41,000,000.  But the company was strong enough to bear the strain, as well as the loss of $3,000,000 in the Russian extension (1867).  The value of its property was increased by twenty millions of dollars within the next ten years."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There was never a drop of water put into Western Union stock," says Hiram Sibley, "before the consolidation with the American Telegraph Company. (The laying of the Atlantic cable (1857) was the enterprise of the American.  It was a powerful organization.  July 1, 1866, it exchanged its capital of $4,000,000 for an issue of $12,000,000 of the Western Union, and was merged with that organization.)  Up to that time the stock of the Western Union measured dollar for dollar with the original aggregate stock of all the companies of which it was composed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Every dollar of Western Union stock represented a dollar par value of the absorbed stock of the old lines.  What some called 'water' was making up of stock - that is adding the original value of the stock purchased.  The capital stock was increased by adding that which was depreciated, and which became valuable in the Western Union."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Sibley's connection with the Western Union practically terminated in 1869, when he resigned his position as Vice-President.  How largely Rochester was represented in the Executive Board of the company, and in its leading stockholders during the sixteen years of its direction by Mr. Sibley is shown in the reports of the company.  Within that sixteen years the number of telegraph offices was increased from 132 to over 4,000, and the value of the property, originally costing $220,000, increased in value to $48,000,000.  The first Secretary and Treasurer, Isaac R. Elwood, of Rochester, had much to do with the management of the lines, and to his superintendence of the great and growing corporation, his foresight in providing for emergencies by contracts and leases that are models of their kind, a good share of the subsequent prosperity of the company is due.  Mr. Elwood was temporarily succeeded by B.R. McAlpine, of Rochester.  The names of Rochester men who have been prominent in "the Western Union" are as follows:  Hiram Sibley, Samuel L. Selden, Isaac R. Elwood, Isaac Butts, Henry S. Potter, Joseph Medbury, Alvah Strong, George H. Mumford, Addison Gardiner, Freeman Clarke, D.A. Watson, O.H. Palmer, E.P. Willis, B.R. McAlpine, R.H. Rochester, J.B. Van Enry, Anson Stager, James S. Ried, Sanford J. Smith.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not one of the present directors is a Rochester man.  Of the first Board only Hiram Sibley and D.A. Watson survive - two names that, as a rule, lead the list of benefactors to the churches of the city whose wealth and development were marvelously increased by the Western Union.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Independent of Western Union," says Mr. Sibley, "I should not be worth one-half to-day of what, through it, I have been able to give away."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Sibley has been a generous donor to the Rochester University.  Sibley Hall was built by him, at a cost of over $100,000, and the University has been enriched by many of his gifts.  The Sibley College of Mechanic Arts, of Cornell University, is another outcome of Western Union, and the founder's old friendship for Ezra Cornell began in the dark days of telegraphy.  The enumeration of Mr. Sibley's public benefactions, with those of other Rochester capitalists who found their fortune in Western Union, is not within the scope of this article.  Suffice it to say that if all that has been done for Rochester by the wealth gained in Western Union could be subtracted, there would be a sorry change.<br>*The laying of the Atlantic cable (1857) was the enterprise of the American.

<li id="c10076.8">[<a href="s14.htm#s449">S449</a>]  <i>Dictionary of American Biography</i>, page 145-146.  SIBLEY, HIRAM (Feb. 6, 1807 - July 12, 1888), business man and promoter, was born at North Adams, Mass., the son of Benjamin and Zilpha (Davis) Sibley.  His education was what the village school could supply.  At an early age, having already practiced the shoemaker's trade, he left North Adams, and went to the village of Lima, N.Y., where he entered a cotton factory.  At twenty-one, he started a machine-shop in the nearby town of Mendon, and there he built up a successful business, of which he was able to dispose at a profit.  He also carried on at this time an extensive wool-carding business at Sparta and Mount Morris.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1838, with the beginnings of a fortune already in hand, he moved to Rochester, N. Y.  Here he engaged in banking and real estate, and acquired sufficient popularity to be elected sheriff of Monroe County in 1843.  During his period of office he came into contact with Royal Earl House, the inventor of the House printing telegraph, then in financial difficulties.  With this contact began Sibley's interest in the telegraph itself.  He was instrumental the next year in obtaining an appropriation from Congress for the support of the experiments carried on by Samuel F. B. Morse, and in 1851 he bought up the House patents and organized the New York & Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company.  Before the end of the year he had built 100 miles of line.  He early formed the conviction, however, that there were too many small companies, and that consolidation was demanded.  Accordingly, in 1854 he formed an association with Ezra Cornell, who had valuable grants under the Morse patents, and the two agreed to form the so-called Western Union Telegraph Company, which was charted in 1856, with Sibley as president.  This position he held for the next ten years.  Under his administration the number of telegraph offices increased from 132 to 4,000, and the value of the property from $220,000 to $48,000,000.  He was the earnest advocate of a transcontinental telegraph line, and, failing to secure the support of his co-directors in the Western Union, he undertook the project on his own account, securing from Congress in 1860 an annual subsidy of $40,000 for ten years and shrewdly coming to terms with a California rival.  The line was a success from the beginning and was amalgamated with the Western Union in 1864.  He had thoughtfully played a leading part in the entertainment of the Russian naval squadron in 1863, and when he visited Russia, soon afterward, was cordially received by the Czar.  Wires were actually strung in Alaska and Siberia when the laying of the trans-Atlantic cable led to the collapse of the project at heavy loss.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retiring from the Western Union Company in 1869, Sibley started an extensive seed and nursery business.  He had also a large interest in railroads in the South and West, and made extensive investments in both sections.  He bought a 40,000-acre farm in Illinois, and much farm land elsewhere, usually letting it out to tenants, and was in 1888 the largest owner of improved lands in the United States.  He also owned timber land and salt mines.  The scale of his agricultural enterprises has hardly been appreciated.  He took an active interest in experiments of all kinds for the improvements of plants; he was much interested in reclamation, as in the case of the Fox Ridge Farm, formerly a swamp, in Central New York; he cultivated the largest farm in that state.  In industry and agricultural pursuits alike, he was a man of extraordinary capacity.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With his friend Ezra Cornell, he was one of the incorporators of Cornell University and to the new institution he gave at various times the sum of $150,000 for the foundation of the Sibley College of Mechanic Arts (now Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering).  He also built and presented Sibley Hall to the University of Rochester, for use as a library.  To Rochester hospitals and other charitable institutions he gave at least $100,000.  His personality was an agreeable one.  He had much humor, and was an excellent raconteur.  In his business operations he practiced the methods of diplomacy rather than those of coercion.  He was simple in his habits and broad in his interests.  His wife was Elizabeth M. (Tinker) who, with a son and daughter, survived him.  He died in Rochester.<a href="e3194.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
