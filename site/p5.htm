<li id="c128.5">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 12 - 13.  Dr. Thomas Hastings, born in Watertown, Mass., July 1, 1652.  Died in Hatfield, July 23, 1712.  He married first, October 10, 1672, Anna Hawks, daughter of John Hawks, of Hadley.  She was the mother of six children, and died October 25, 1705.  He married second, February 14, 1706, Mary Burt, daughter of David Burt, of Northampton.  She died April 13, 1734.  Dr. Hastings was admitted freeman at Hatfield, February 8, 1678.  He was the only physician for Northampton, Hadley, Hatfield and Deerfield, and all the country around.  He was also the first school teacher Hatfield ever had.  According to Temple's History of Whately, page 20, "It was not uncommon to unite the professions of physician and teacher in the same person, and, as the grandmothers were mainly relied upon for prescriptions and poultices, he (Dr. Hastings) seems to have found sufficient time for the discharge of duty in the double capacity."  It is a remarkable fact, in regard to this school taught by Dr. Hastings, that girls were admitted from the outset and pursued the same studies as the boys, remarkable because such liberality was unknown elsewhere in New England until after the Revolution.  In Boston girls were not admitted to the public schools until 1789 (see Boston School Report, 1866, page 28); in Northampton not until 1802 (see Judd's History of Hadley, page 65).  In view of these facts, there seems to be a certain historic fitness that a Hatfield woman should found the first woman's college in New England (Smith College, at Northampton).  Dr. Hastings' son, Dr. Thomas Hastings second, also taught school in Hatfield.  Eight of Dr. Hastings' nine children survived him.  Of the three youngest by his second wife, Silence, born February 26, 1707, alone lived to maturity, Thankful and Sylvanus having died in infancy.  Silence Hastings married Josiah Hadlock.</li>

Thomas Hastings, aged 29, and wife Susanna, aged 34, embarked at Ipswich, England, April 10, 1634, in the "Elizabeth," William Andrews, master, for New England, and settled in Watertown, Mass., then known as "The Massachusetts Bay Colony," where he was admitted freeman, May 6, 1635.  He "laid down" a lot in Dedham in 1635 or 6, but never lived there.  Was selectman from 1638 to 1643, and again from 1650 to 1671; town clerk, 1671, 1677, 1680; representative, 1673, and long held the office of deacon.  His wife, Susanna, died childless, February 2, 1650, and he married, April 2, 1651, Margaret Cheney, daughter of William and Martha Cheney, of Roxbury, Mass.  She was the mother of all his children.  He died in 1685, aged 80 years.  According to an inventory, dated September 9, 1685, his real estate amounted to 421 pounds.  He owned two farms, and as many as fifteen other lots.  He was grantee for seven lots, the remainder he purchased.  The west side of School Street, then called Hill Street, was always his residence.  His homestead passed to his son Samuel.  In his will, dated March 12, 1682-83, proved September 7, 1685, he gave to his oldest son Thomas, who received a professional education, only 5 pounds, saying:  "I have been at great expense to bring him up a scholar, and I have given him above three-score pounds to begin the world with."  To his sons John, Joseph, Benjamin, Nathaniel, Samuel, and to his daughter, Hepzibah Bond, he gave each 40 pounds.  To his granddaughter Margaret (eldest daughter of his son Thomas) he gave 5 pounds, and to her sister Hannah 3 pounds, and the remainder to his wife Margaret.</li>

Montyne Vialee Benham passed away April 24, 2005 at her home in Williams, Arizona.  Montyne was born February 12, 1916 to Stella Leeora and Leslie Kemp in Memphis, Texas. In 1930, while living in Mentmore, New Mexico, she met and married Dan Schnell.  They moved to Boulder, Colorado, had two children, a son Danny Lee, and a daughter, Sandra Jo, a couple of years later.   Mr. Schnell passed away in 1941.  In 1942 Montyne met and married Henry Benham while living in Winslow, Arizona.  After their marriage they moved to Boulder, Colorado, where Hank&#8217;s daughter Mary Frances joined the family.  While living in Boulder their son Larry was born.  In 1946 Montyne and Hank along with their children moved to Williams, from Boulder, Colorado, where the youngest son Mike was born.  Montyne and Hank spent the rest of their lives in Williams.  During the warm season, Montyne enjoyed cooking Sunday dinner, preparing a picnic lunch, or just visiting with their many guests at the Benham ranch.  Montyne grew fields of gladiolas, raised turkeys, chickens, vegetables and her children.  During the school year Montyne lived in Williams, where she worked as a Harvey Girl that supported the troop trains coming through Williams.  Later she worked at Rod&#8217;s Steak house, the Williams Hospital, the election board and Forest Service roadblocks.  Montyne was active in the school programs, Ladies Hospital Auxiliary and was a member and supporter of the Methodist Church.

<li id="c142.6">[<a href="s3.htm#s490">S490</a>] Notes by Barbara Benham Dittmann for the service of Montyne Benham, May 5, 2005.  Dear Benham Family, I want to share with you and your family how much your mother, Montyne, has meant to me over the sixty some years that I have known her. Mostly I remember her as being a happy person. When you think about it, how many really happy people do you know? I think Montyne truly enjoyed her life and her family. She was always making some rye observation about someone&#8217;s behavior or giving a silly twist to someone&#8217;s remark. She kept everyone chuckling. Everyone in her presence felt loved and listened to. Her responses were loving but funny. Everyone seemed to be having such a good time.  My first recollection of Montyne was one night when I was probably about four years old, and our family from California was visiting Gram and Gramp at the Benham Ranch in Williams. At that time, Henry, Montyne and family lived in what was called the Perkins House, an old farm house built on Government property with a ninety-nine year lease. It was a few hundred yards from the Benham ranch house where my family was staying with Gram and Gramp. I remember Mr. Perkins and his wife. The lease on that house ended, and the house was torn down many years ago.  My parents, evidently, had something they wanted to do one evening, and my brother Jim, then called Jay, and I were to be put to bed at Montyne&#8217;s house and then later retrieved by our parents when they got back to the ranch. I was scared to death. I had to spend the night in the home of almost strangers, and I was so afraid of the dark. If you want to know what dark is, go out to the ranch on a moonless night in the 40&#8217;s. You can&#8217;t see anything when the lights are out; not even the ghosts and monsters and bears that are making the floor boards creak and are just about to creep into your bed. Worst of all, the toilet was outside in the very, very, dark - called an outhouse. Well, I being one prone to wetting the bed anyway, was in pure terror. But I remember Montyne, busy with her own brood, took the time to make me feel welcome and left a light on so I wouldn&#8217;t be scared.   Another time Jay and I were shipped off to stay with Gram and Gramp for a couple weeks during the summer that I was seven. One of the daily chores was to see that Montyne&#8217;s beautiful glads, as she call them, got watered. Those of you who remember Gram know that she was pretty strict and didn&#8217;t put up with much nonsense or silly business. I remember going fishing with Larry. We would go to the upper dam by the Perkins House early in the morning to get a can full of worms and then go the the lower dams and fish. The only problem was that we were expected to EAT those fish that we caught, at the noontime dinner. (By the way, in California we had breakfast, lunch and dinner, but at the ranch there was breakfast, dinner and supper.) Well Gram had never heard of a persnickety eater and wasn&#8217;t about to make room in her home for one that summer. Among the many other sins I committed that summer was climbing a tree and sitting in some pitch and then getting the pitch on my bedspread. Also I ate too many cookies.   One day Gram had something to do, and Jay and I were to spend the day with Montyne. When we got there, the boys told me I couldn&#8217;t play with them, so I hung around in the house. I remember how good Montyne smelled, and how lovely her house smelled. Everything was so beautiful, clean and orderly. She was so cheerful and upbeat. She even paid attention to me and talked to me. I think this was the day that I fell in love with Montyne and would always think fondly on her and be glad when I had a chance to visit her.   As I&#8217;ve grown up and had a family of my own, I&#8217;ve always tried to take lessons from Montyne about how she lived her life with such naturalness, ease and cheer. She was never at a loss for words, and she made everyone in her presence feel welcome and comfortable. Her home always seemed perfect, but never at the expense of the people living or visiting there. I loved to hear the friendly banter between Montyne and her family members. Truths were told, but always in a humorous manner and with a loving spirit. What the world could have learned from her gently humor. I count Montyne as one of my mentors even though I&#8217;m sure she nor anyone else had a clue that I adored her. I will miss her presence in this world, but know that she has made a huge impact on the people she has known. Even me, a niece from California, who was only in her presence a day or two every few summers. I know she enjoyed her life and family, and she has inspired me to make lemonade whenever possible. Thanks, Montyne. You who have known her better than I are truly blessed.   With Love, Barbara (Dittmann).</li>

<li id="c145.9">[<a href="s3.htm#s305">S305</a>]  <i>Dr. Titus Hull</i>, page 72.  Titus Hull was born March 25, 1750/51 in Wallingford, New Haven County, Connecticut, the son of Dr. Zephaniah Hull and Hannah (Doolittle) Hull, who shortly thereafter removed to Bethlehem in Litchfield County.  Titus Hull was descended from a long line of Connecticut doctors, encompassing six generations, including himself and his three physician sons.  In November of 1760 when Titus was only nine, both of his parents died of the "Great Sickness" on the same day, along with two siblings.  Three children survived -- Titus, Lydia, age, seven, and Andrew, age five.  Interestingly, soon after the deaths, a flock of quail flew over the garden and fell dead except for three which arose and flew away!  After the death of his parents, Titus was sent to be raised by an uncle at Cheshire, New Haven County, Connecticut.  In 1776, he served as a Minuteman from Bethlehem during the Revolutionary War.  He later began his medical studies which he finished with Dr. Seth Bird of Litchfield and then moved back to Bethlehem to his father's farm.  His first wife, whom he married in 1773 and by whom he had two children who died in infancy, was Lucy/Lucia Parmalee.
