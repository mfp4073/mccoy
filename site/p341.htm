Lee died very suddenly at St. Paul, Minn., on the 10th inst., at the age of thirty-eight.  He was a resident of Mount Morris, but spent his earlier years in the town of Clarkson.  In October 1861 Colonel Lee raised an independent battery in Wyoming and Monroe counties and this company was mustered into the service at Buffalo, and subsequently stationed at Newburn, N.C.  Colonel Lee after several years of active duty came home with an impaired constitution.  Later he had charge for many years of the New York military agency at Washington, which position he occupied till it was abandoned by the state.  Some two weeks since he left Mount Morris for Minnesota, in hopes of regaining his health, but suddenly has he passed away; his death greatly lamented; a devoted wife and three children survive him.  His remains will be brought to Mount Morris for interment.  The funeral will take place on Wednesday the 15th.<a href="e3125.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Rarely has our community been so deeply moved as by the unexpected death of Miss Katie H. Lee, daughter of Mrs. Henry W. McNair, which occurred after a lingering illness, on Sunday morning, March 9th; for many months she has been a great sufferer, but it was hoped that her strong constitution would survive the attack, but from the first the disease has been unyielding to the most devoted care and powerful remedies.  In the bloom of life she has left us, beloved and most deeply lamented.  Though but just past seventeen years of age she had displayed rare and lovely traits of character, conscientious in all things, loving, affectionate and gentle, ever devoted to those about her, and daily illustrating those little acts of kindness that make life so radiant in the family circle.  Her simplicity and quiet ways won the hearts of all, while her Christian life was exemplary and beautiful.  Her patience during her long illness was only equaled by her confiding trust that the kind Father would order all things well with her, hopefully and cheerfully she went down to the grave to the last sustained by the christians hope.  The memory of her young and beautiful life will be most affectionately cherished, over her grave will we gather our sweetest Immortelles, that so truly typify's the land whither she has gone, where flowers find immortal bloom.  Her funeral was largely attended from the family residence on Tuesday afternoon, Rev. Dr. Parsons officiating.<a href="e3113.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Another of the dear children of God has exchanged the infelicities of this mortal life for the blessedness of the glorified.  Nellie, wife of George S. Hastings, Esq., and daughter of Hon. Cheney Ames and Emily North, aged thirty-six, entered into rest April 29th, from Hoboken, N.J.  From early childhood she was a remarkable character.  At the age of twelve her mother died, leaving her the eldest of five children.  Before she was fourteen she went to boarding-school, taking in charge with her a brother, and an invalid sister of four years.  The sister-mother quietly and fully met all the obligations of her position, maintained a good standing for thorough scholarship, and won the hearts alike of teachers and pupils, by her sunny disposition, rare conscientiousness, and wonderful efficiency.  Before she was sixteen she left school, and took the entire charge of her father's household in Oswego, and to her tender care and patient fidelity in watching over the younger children, and aiding and comforting her father, all bear grateful and loving witness.<br> In the Summer of 1862 she came to Perry a lovely bride, and though she left in the Fall, the fragrance of her memory there will not cease until the present generation passes away.  The occasion of her leaving was the enlistment of her husband, whom she followed to North Carolina, where for over a year she made a home for the officers of her husband's Battery, and did all in her power to soften the rough phases of army life for our brave boys.  How her cheery presence and kind speech brightened that lonely camp!  The capture of the Battery (a few hours previous she had been sent to a place of safety) turned her steps to her father's house; not to sigh and grieve over the imprisonment of her husband in Macon, Ga., but to exhibit an example of cheerful submission to the Divine will, and unshaken confidence in the goodness of her heavenly Father, beautiful to witness.<br> In a few months her husband, in company with others, escaped, and very soon thereafter exchanged the perilous hardships of the fugitive for an honorable place in the Executive Department at Albany.  The change produced no undue elation in Nellie; it simply converted her trust into gratitude, her patience into joy.  The smile that afflictions could not remove, only became warmer and deeper.  Amid all the attractions of the Capitol there was no place to her like the house of the Lord, and no treat like the sermons of her pastor, Dr. Darling.<br> A few years ago Mr. Hastings removed to New York, where and in Hoboken, she has since lived, actively engaged in all good work up to the full extent of her opportunities.  As a mother she excelled; her influence over her children was unbounded.  While very young she would talk to them of Jesus as a present loving friend, whom they should habitually seek to please.  No part of her religion ever seemed to be put on.  It was part of herself, a second gracious nature.  It was impossible for any one to question its reality, or to be uninfluenced by its beauty and power.  She was very sympathetic, always obedient to the precept "Bear ye one another's burdens."  How many wearied with life's trials she has cheered, and into their aching hearts infused something of her own bright trust, and never waning faith.  As one who knew and loved her well, writes, "To me Nellie was an unspeakable blessing and comfort," so can every one of her intimate friends testify.<br> What she was to her husband, and how great is his bereavement, words are utterly inadequate to express.  With a sweet childlike simplicity and hopefulness so characteristic, she said to him when near her end, "This frustrates many of our plans; never mind, we will carry them out in heaven."  Tenderly do we commend him and the motherless, to the unfailing faithfulness of our covenant-keeping God.<a href="e3116.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Wednesday afternoon our community were greatly shocked by the announcement of the death of Mary L. Coy, wife of John M. Hastings, Esq., which occurred at three o'clock p.m. of that day.  For several days it had been known her situation was extremely critical, but it was hoped a strong constitution would carry her through, but suddenly her bright life so full of hope and joyful expectation went out, and the pall of death enshrouds every household in our community.  In June last, full of joy, and beautifully illustrating the graces of youthful womanhood, she stood at the alter plighting her troth, and receiving the warmest congratulations of a host of friends, to-day these friends morn her loss and are deeply moved.  Her gentle ways, her kindness of heart, her graceful manners, and above all her  christian deportment, have left their sweet fragrance in many a household.  She was universally beloved, and a favorite with all.  Over her youthful grave will we garland the choicest flowers, and as years pass on will the memory of her beautiful life illumine our pathway to the celestial city.  She was twenty-five years of age, and daughter of Lorin and Harriet Coy.  Her funeral will take place Friday afternoon at two o'clock, from the residence on Chapel Street.<a href="e3117.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

At Honolulu, Sandwich Islands, July 12, "suddenly, while sitting in his chair," Dr. G.P. Judd, aged 70.  The "Hawaiian Gazette" says of him:  "Dr. Judd was born at Paris, N.Y., April 23, 1803.  He came out under the appointment of physician to the American mission, arriving here with the second reinforcement of missionaries, in March, 1828.  In 1842, he resigned his connection with the mission, [break?] took possession of the Islands, in 1843, Dr. Judd was appointed one of the Joint Commission, to represent the king; but soon resigned the office when he found the Commission bent on abrogating the salutary laws restraining licentiousness and crime, which had lately been established.  When Admiral Thomas restored the sovereignty to Kamehameha III., July 31, 1843, Dr. Judd was invited by the king to organize a Ministry, which he did by selecting R. C. Wyllie to be Minister of Foreign Affairs, himself Minister of the Interior, and John Ricord, Attorney-General.  This was the first Cabinet the Hawaiian Government ever had.  In the following year, 1844 or 1845, the Cabinet was increased to four Ministers, and he took the portfolio of the Finance Department, which he held till 1853.  In 1849, he accompanied the then Princes Liholiho and Lot to Europe, to make new treaties, and endeavor to settle the difficulty which occurred with France in that year.  The ten years during which he held office were probably the stormiest decade in the modern political history of Hawaii, and it required a man of the firmness of Dr. Judd to steer the frail ship of state which had been launched on a stormy sea.  To his tact and wisdom, aided by his associates, Wyllie, Richards, Ricord, Lee, and Andrews, are the Hawaiian people indebted for the admirable system of constitutional government then established, and which has secured peace and quiet for over thirty years.  When he entered the service of the king and organized for him a government, he found him encumbered with a load of debt, paying exorbitant interest. By a system of prudent economy and rigid circumspection, he paid off these debts, and established for the Hawaiian Government an enviable financial reputation, which is has preserved to this day.  To him, more than to any other man, living or dead, belongs whatever honor is due for our present national credit, as well as for many of the substantial improvements in the city.  But it was as a citizen, and a warm friend of the Hawaiians, that his influence for good was felt most.  Among the older natives, now rapidly dropping off, who knew him best, he was looked to as a faithful counselor, and loved as a father."<a href="e3121.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

The centre and controlling mind of that home has been the lady whose demise we now chronicle,  Dr. Judd's career as an officer of the Hawaiian Government and missionary physician forms a part of the nation's history, but in all his labors, which have been incessant for more than forty years, and part of the time very onerous as one of the King's Ministers, Mrs. Judd is well known to have been a cordial help-meet and wise counselor of her husband.  She deeply sympathized with the King, chiefs and nation when struggling for national independence, and until within a few years her influence was felt in the national councils.  Most emphatically was this true during the reign of Kamehameha III.  Not only will her loss be felt by her large and deeply beloved family and wide circle of relations, but also by the community at large.

At Fairfield, Iowa, April 20th, 1863, Mrs. Carrie E., wife of John H. Wells, aged 35 years<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A little more than one year ago we rejoiced in the consummation of a long cherished attachment; to-day we mourn because she is not.  From a large circle of weeping friends, from her agonized husband, from her place in the Sabbath School, from the Choir, in the Church and in the social circle, the Lord has taken her to his heavenly Home.  We mourn not on her account, for though modest in profession she had formed years ago a Christian character of a high order.  This was matured in a life of humble piety, and beautifully developed in its closing scenes.  Her mind was not only calm in prospect of separation from those she so much loved, but faith enabled her to meet the last enemy with joy, and to triumph over him.  Her prayers prompted not only our amens, but it was hard to restrain our allebrias.  She begged us to sing around her bedside those favorite hymns we had found so edifying in public and social worship.  She herself sung with us until her voice was lost in the dying struggle, and then her spirit sung through her eyes, and every feature of her countenance meaning the praise her lips could not utter; and when the last dreadful struggle was announced and almost over, a smile of holy joy spread over her face, assuring us that she was now looking within the veil and had begun the song of the ransomed spirit around the throne of God and the Lamb.  Though dead she yet speaks, calling us to follow her in a life of gospel obedience, that we may meet her in glory.  The following lines are taken from the <i> Evangelist,</i> of April 16, 1863, as exceedingly appropriate to the bereaved friends, and to the character of our glorified Carrie:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sweetly rest gentle spirit, thy labors are done, / Earth's conflicts are ended and victory won, / Forever reposing on Jesus' dear breast, / Rest, rest weary spirit, eternally rest.  How soon hast thou left us, how transient they stay, / But thou couldst not linger on life's barren way, / Then wert bound for the skies far above the blue dome, / Then why shouldst thou linger away from thy home? Farewell, our heart's treasurer, we bid thee adieiu / Until time has borne us life's journey quite through, / O, then with our Saviour our joys we'll renew, / In a country were sorrow our cheeks ne'er bedew.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then rest, gentle spirit, thy labors are done.  Thy conflicts are ended and victory won, Forever reposing on Jesus' dear breast, Rest, rest weary spirit, eternally rest.<a href="e3126.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

In his religious belief, Mr. Hastings was a Presbyterian, and was one of the most zealous members of the Central church, which he joined with his wife, December 1, 1848.  He held many offices during his membership, and for many years was president of the board of trustees.  The deceased was a great lover of music and one of the foremost in organizing the Oratorio and several other musical societies.  He leaves a wife, two sons, Charles and Henry, and a daughter, Ella.

His clear intelligence was too discriminating to imposed upon and those who knew him learned to rely upon his judgment.  Firm in his convictions and positive in character, he was also a man of broad and tender sympathies, and personally and socially he was one of the most genial and companionable of men."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He married Evelyn Seymour, daughter of James Seymour, and sister of Charles Seymour, who married Jane E.
