<li id="c1292.11">[<a href="s7.htm#s728">S728</a>] Civil War Information for Samuel T. Gilbert, The following paragraphs contain some of the more interesting information contained in some 90 pages of Samuel T. Gilbert's pension file from service in the Civil War.  Generally, it contains requests for an increase to his pension, surgeon's reports, affidavits from friends and neighbors that Samuel had no "vicious habits" and other correspondence.  Samuel's initial claim for a disability pension included rheumatism and varicose veins.  Later, he lists blindness of left eye and disease of eyes, heart disease, sciatic nerve problems and finally a general "brake-down" of his health and old age.  It is interesting that initially Samuel spells his wife's given name as Rebecka.  But by 1915 he was spelling it Rebecca.  Also note that his daughter, Martha M. Gilbert Wilson, who took care of him in his last 6 weeks of his life is not mentioned in either list of his children that he enumerates on two separate occasions.  The following information is listed in the order it appears in the pension file rather than strictly chronological.  <br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Declaration for Original Invalid Pension:  On this 6 day of Sept. 1883 Samuel T.

<li id="c1297.6">[<a href="s8.htm#s59">S59</a>] Obituary of John B. Gilbert.  John B. Gilbert was born November 27, 1857, at Olive Hill, Kentucky, and died July 4, 1921, at Perry, Iowa, aged sixty three years, six months and seven days. He removed to Prairie City, Iowa, April 17, 1865, where he resided for a number of years.  Later he purchased a farm in Guthrie county which he operated successfully for many years.  After disposing of his holdings in Guthrie county he resided in Coon Rapids, Iowa.  For the past several years he has made his home in Perry, Iowa, where he passed away in the King's Daughter Hospital. The deceased realized that the end was near at hand and talked of his passing without alarm.  Although for some reason he had not identified himself with the Church, yet he believed in and respected Christianity.  He was a devout student of God's Word, and tried, in an unassuming way, to exemplify the principles of Jesus Christ in all his dealings with his fellow men.  He was quiet and retiring, loved by his friends, and held in the highest esteem by his business associates.  To the unfortunate and needy he was a kind, constant and liberal friend.  In a remarkable degree he had the good will and admiration of the children of his home city, and the news of his severe illness caused them great alarm and his sudden death profound sorrow. He had a passion for the beautiful in nature, and found much pleasure in adorning his home with rare and beautiful flowers. These choice and fragrant blossoms, that have the place of honor on his casket, were his friends in life, and as he would wish it, they are his friends in death.  Together they will fade and vanish from view of mortal eyes, to come forth again in the morning of the Spring Day of time and of eternity. Two sisters and two brothers are the immediate survivors who mourn the going of a patient, loyal, loving brother, as follows:  Mrs. Martha Durbin of Coon Rapids, Iowa;  Miss Amanda Gilbert of Prairie City, Iowa;  Alden Gilbert of Wells, Minnesota; and H. Gilbert of Perry, Iowa. The remains were brought to Prairie City, and funeral services were conducted from the Methodist church, Rev. D. J. McKay officiating. Interment in Westview cemetery. CARD OF THANKS: We wish to express our sincere thanks to friends and neighbors for their kindness and helpfulness during our bereavement.  Mr. and Mrs. James Durbin.  Mr. and Mrs. Harrison Gilbert.  Mr. and Mrs. Alden Gilbert.  Amanda Gilbert.<a href="e2282.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Gilbert, was born in Jasper county on the 29th day of September, 1865, and was called to rest on July 14, 1946, at the age of 80 years, 9 months and 14 days at the home of her nephew, Clarence Main, near Colfax. At the age of 44 years she moved to Prairie City to make her home. On March 19, 1930, she was united in marriage to John T. French, who preceded her in death Feb. 27, 1937. She had been an active and faithful member of the Methodist church more than 40 years until poor health prevented. She also had been an active member of the W. R. C. for 35 years, Rebekah lodge and Blue Bird Circle. She was preceded in death by seven sisters and three brothers.  Left to mourn her passing are two brothers, Harrison Gilbert of Perry, Iowa, and Alden Gilbert of Wells, Minn; a step-son, Jay French, of San Gabriel, Calif.; many nieces and nephews and a host of friends. "Aunt Mandy" as she was called by many was well known in and around Prairie City and surrounding community. Peacefully sleeping, resting at last, The world's weary trouble and trials are passed.  In silence she suffered, In patience she bore, Till God called her home, To suffer no more.

Two pretty weddings occurred Wednesday morning, June 16th at the home of the brides' uncle, Mr. and Mrs. J.C. Sanders, at Carlisle when Miss Bessie E. Sanders wedded Dr. Kramer M. Gilbert and Miss Beulah A. Sanders became the wife of Dr. Carl Kail.  The brides were the two oldest daughters of Mr. and Mrs. D.F. Sanders.  They were born and grew to charming womanhood in Carlisle.  They graduated from our schools.  Mrs. Gilbert has taught for a number of years in East Des Moines, while Mrs. Kail taught for two years near Carlisle.  The young ladies possess happy and friendly disposition, are industrious and ambitious and have a host of friends both young and old.<br> The grooms were former classmates at Drake University, both graduating the same year from that institution.  Dr. Gilbert is now located at Curlew, Iowa, and Dr. Kail is practicing medicine at Stratford, Iowa.<br> The colors of pink, white and green were carried out in the decorations of the home, ferns and pink and white roses being used in profusion.<br> The brides' gowns were white with lace trimmings and each carried a shower bouquet of brides roses.  Little Marion Sanders, sister of the brides, in an all over embroidery dress, opened the door.<br> The guests were received by Mr. and Mrs. D.F. Sanders and Mr. and Mrs. J.C. Sanders.<br> Promptly at eight-thirty o'clock Miss Carrie Brown played Mendelssohn wedding march.  The bridal couple took their places under an arch of white roses and ferns.  Rev. C. Brewer, of the Methodist church, of Carlisle, came forward and read an impressive service that united them as husband and wife.<br> After congratulations were bestowed the bridal parties and guests partook of a three course breakfast at the completion of which Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert were taken to the depot where they left for their new home at Curlew, Iowa.  Dr. and Mrs. Kail remained until the next morning so as to be present at a reception given at the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Kail in their honor.<br> The guests were: Mrs. L.M. Gilbert, mother of Dr. Gilbert, Mr. and Mrs. G.A. Gilbert, Mr. S.R.

Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert were pioneer settlers in Chandler and for years Dr. Gilbert was the only physician in this entire area.  They built the third house in Chandler, which at that time was only a budding community.  The house at 140 North Colorado Street, still stands and Mrs. Gilbert continued to live there until eight years ago when she moved to California to be with her only son, Horace Gilbert.  During her younger years, Mrs. Gilbert took an active part in the social and community life of Chandler and was a charter member of the Chandler Woman's Club.

<li id="c1307.9">[<a href="s8.htm#s487">S487</a>] REMEMBRANCES OF BESSIE GILBERT BY HER SON HORACE-- READ AT HER FUNERAL MARCH 10, 1979, In the fall of 1912 a young couple from Iowa accompanied by their infant son left on an eventful trip West in their open touring car.  They were motivated to make this rather rash move because this young doctor had become tired of making night calls in the deep snow at below zero temperatures in the Iowa farm countryside.  I can truthfully say that this young couple--my father and mother--were not aware that, at that time, there were no roads from Iowa to the West--only wagon trails.  As was true of so many young couples of that time and this, they were little concerned with the problems of their lives; they were only concerned with their ambitions and their hopes for the future.  About six weeks of adventures too numerous to mention here, they made their way down the then new Apache Trail into Mesa a day or so before Christmas.  I have often heard my mother say that she was amazed to see roses blooming as they drove through Mesa.  They immediately fell in love with the Salt River Valley and decided to settle there rather than continuing on to California, which was their original plan.  During a sight seeing trip around the Valley they visited the newly organized townsite of Chandler.  Dr. A. J. Chandler only a few months earlier laid out the town and was then promoting the sale of lots.  Dr. Chandler painted a glowing picture of the future of the area and told them of the great winter resort hotel, the San Marcos, which at that time was nothing more than an excavation in the ground.  My father and mother decided that this was indeed an opportunity for them and they felt they could be of service to this growing community.  My father took the Arizona State Medical Board Examination in January, 1913, and very soon put out his shingle in front of a tent pitched near the spot where they soon built the home they lived in until my mother came to live with me in California in 1970.  Life was quite primitive in Chandler in 1913.  My parents soon moved out of the tent into a house, but of course, at that time, there was no water system in town.  They received water in buckets from a water wagon each morning.  There was no electricity, hence they used kerosine lamps for illumination.  Their only heating was an old wood burning stove in the living room.  Since air conditioning and insulation had not yet been discovered, the summers were miserable in these lightly built homes--but my parents persevered throughout those early years; and soon there was a water system, there was electricity and later insulation and air conditioning.  I could tell you many tales of life in Chandler in the early years.  In those years came the school system, the early telephones and in 1920 the first paved streets.  One of the early institutions in Chandler was the Methodist Church.  In the first few months of their residency, my parents, along with other pioneers started this church.  To mind comes the names of Appleby and Knox, but there were others.  They were all people of determination and vision.  I think back on the 65 years since my parents came to Chandler.  They endured hardships, but they made a good life for themselves and I am sure they related well to the life of the community during their many active years.  Although we are here today to honor my mother, I cannot speak of her without referring to my father for theirs was always a wonderful partnership.  Whatever "papa" wanted was always agreeable to my mother.  My mother passed away, to the day, 19 years after the death of my father.  I recall vividly his services at this same chapel.  Following his passing, my mother maintained the family home at 141 N. Colorado Street until in 1970 she was forced to come to California to live with me and my family.  My wife, our daughter and I look back fondly on the four years she lived with us until a stroke confined her to a rest home.  She was kind; she was gentle; she was patient.  She was self sufficient during the entire period she lived with us taking care of her own room and walking up the stairs to our dining room for her meals each and every day with a cheery smile and a good word for all.  For those of you who do not understand her walking up stairs rather than down, our home is in the hills and instead of having bedrooms up stairs, ours are down following the contour of the hill.  After the tragic stroke took her from us, even in her impaired condition, she continued her gentle ways.  Her nurses loved her through the 3 1/2 years she was confined to bed and a wheel chair.  Her last nurse daily referred to her as her "doll."  She died in her nurse's arms Tuesday, March 6, 1979 as she had lived--gentle to the end.<a href="e2608.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

By Mrs. Bessie Sanders Gilbert.  Dear Friends, The editor of The Optimist requested me to write an account of my trip from Curlew, Ia to Chandler, Ariz. in our auto.  It is a dreadful task to try to recall the many incidents of so long a trip.  We traveled about 2500 miles and were about six weeks on the road.  We actually spent about three weeks traveling.  The other three weeks we spent at hotels where we stopped for repairs and rest.  We left Curlew, Ia. at 2 P.M., Saturday, Nov. 2.  One of our lady friends wanted to stop at a small town on our way to Stratford.  So she and her two small children went with us.  We had gone only two miles when we heard a terrible racket.  Mrs. Taylor exclaimed "Oh, Doctor!  The trunk is dragging."  The trunk rack had a flaw in it and had broken and if it had not been for the leather straps the trunk would have been lost, as was our lamp and number.  We dumped our trunk into the back seat and journeyed on toward Stratford.  About four o'clock we reached the place where Mrs. Taylor stopped to visit friends.  At Humboldt, we stopped at Frank Gotch's garage to get a tank of gas for our lights.  Mr. Gotch's partner waited on us and seemed a very agreeable gentleman.  Later we found that he had switched a searchlight tank for our Presto tank which caused us a lot of trouble, as you will see later.  At nine o'clock we reached Dr. Kail's at Stratford and eagerly devoured the belated supper that was waiting for us.  Next morning my brother, Garlan, joined us and motored with us to Carlisle.  It was a beautiful morning and we had a fine ride until we attempted to ford a creek where a bridge was out.  On examination we found we would have to send three miles to Des Moines for repairs.  In the meantime we hired a farmer to pull the auto out of the ditch with his team.  A drunken sot came out and interfered with us causing a little trouble.  Garlan was disgusted and said he was downright glad he was not going with us.  We reached Carlisle at 4 P.M.  We were terribly hungry, having no dinner.  After having our trunk rack repaired next morning we started for Des Moines where our arrangements were completed.  There we met Dr. and Mrs. Jordon who had been making a farewell visit to their parents.  It was 4 P.M. before we got ready to leave the city.  After a long cold ride of 110 miles to Lewis, Iowa (Dr. Jordon's home town.)  We were entertained at a home of one of their friends where a fine hot supper was waiting us.  I was so stiff from the cold and holding my sleeping baby, I could hardly get out of the auto.  Dr. Jordon hustled around to close up his business and early next day, we started on our journey for the golden west.  We broke a spring but reached Hamburg, a good sized town, in extreme Southwest Iowa.  The hotel had more style than things to eat.  Next morning we had our spring repaired.  We had gone too far West, so had to return a long way.  That night we camped ten miles from St. Joseph.  Horace did not like to sleep in a tent so cried quite lustily for an hour or more.  Don't know as I blame him much, for the tent was small and somewhat crowded with four people and a baby in it.  We cooked our supper by a camp fire, and I can't say I relish cooking that is half dirt.  Next morning I was so cold I thought my hands and feet would freeze off.  The engine was so cold it took us more than an hour to get it warmed up enough to climb the hill.  We went on to St. Joseph, got gas and started for Kansas City.  Twice that day we were stuck in the mud because we attempted to cross where bridges were out.  We found another spring, and there was a terrific rain, so my impression of Missouri is not pleasant.  We reached Kansas City early in the evening, and stayed that night and most of the next day with Mary Harrod Morris, college friend of Mrs. Jordon.  Kramer took the auto to the J. I. Case Co. and had it thoroughly overhauled.  By four o'clock we were on our way.  After motoring for about thirty miles we camped for the night.  As we traveled through south-western Iowa, northern Missouri and eastern Kansas, we were impressed with the prosperous homes and elegant farms of the farmers.  The homes were simply grand, like you might expect to see in big cities.  At Kansas City we took the old Santa Fe trail followed by the Mormons on their trip to Utah.  Our faces were sunburned, and when we encountered a sand storm it was quite painful until we put the curtains on the auto.  Kansas is noted for its good roads and as the trail followed the railroad it kept us from being lonesome.  Traveling through Colorado we saw tons of sugar beets.  They do not raise much else out in that country.  From La Junta, to Trinidad we were unable to keep the right road as our guide book was not very explicit.  We traveled by moonlight until we came to some hay stacks.  This looked as though there might be human beings not far distant.  You must now remember we were now traveling through a wild unsettled country, towns about every 125 miles.  We had only a little water for the baby so the rest of us had to drink sparingly of some grape juice.  Washing our hands was out of the question.  The next morning it was so cold we did not stop to cook breakfast but we discovered a ranch house about 200 yards away, and learned that the people would have gladly entertained us had they known of our presence.  Here we filled our water bag, and learned how to get back to the right road.  We hurried on to Trinidad, where we had breakfast and dinner in one at 11 A.M.  That afternoon we motored over the Raton pass into New Mexico.  Right at the foot of the mountain, is a town called Raton, and we passed under a sign saying "Welcome to New Mexico."  The highest elevation we reached, crossing the pass, was 10,000 feet.  Most of the time it seemed we were going right down the mountain side.  Our hearts went pit-a-pat, and our nostrils filled with the smell of burning rubber, caused by the break bans getting hot, but before many days, we got used to making such perilous descents.  In this part of New Mexico the land is all fenced in big pastures, and when we came to the fences, we found trough like bridges for the auto to pass over.  We were about to cross one of these bridges when Mrs. Jordon exclaimed "You be sure to hit that bridge" of course we didn't, and a broken spring was the result.  We reached the town of Maxwell after dark, secured quarters at a good hotel where we remained until the next afternoon, that we might have our spring mended.  About seven the next night we reached Wagon Mound, where we found another dandy hotel.  We were certainly surprised to find such fine hotel accommodations, for we thought they would be like the Iowa hotels in small towns.  Being tourists, they graciously allowed us to pay the highest prices.  As you enter Wagon Mound there is a small mountain that looks like a covered wagon.  Right here I began to get a poor opinion of New Mexico.  It was just dust, dust, dust.  About noon the next day, we reached the hustling town of Las Vegas, where doctor telegraphed for springs to meet us at Albuquerque.  We laid in a supply of groceries and journeyed on to Santa Fe.  We passed through several Mexican towns, of adobe houses, the citizens were very forbidding in looks.  They would rush to the doors and show their white teeth and laugh as if we were freaks.  We thought we would do most anything rather than spend the night in one of those towns so we traveled on and would have reached Santa Fe if we had had lights.  After the sun went down it got so cold, we thought we would rather sit up in our auto all night than get out and put up our tent.  I never spent a more miserable night I think.  I had ridden 100 miles that day and worried with the baby, so I was no fit subject to sit in an auto all night, when I was already stiff with cold.  I scarcely dared move for fear the baby would wake and cry.  It seemed the night would never end, and I surely would die of exhaustion.  I would wonder from one minute to the next how much longer I could hold on to the baby.  Remember Kramer was crowded behind the driving wheel and had no room to hold the baby.  When four o'clock came we climbed out, and built a roaring fire of some dead pines we found on the mountain.  Day broke about six o'clock and we journeyed on to through Padurita and Glorieta over crooked roads through the Government reserve to the Montezuma hotel, at Santa Fe.  We reached there in time to take our baths before dinner.  After diving in our trunks for our best clothes we did not feel any too fine as the hotel was full of swells attending the Scottish rites convention.  We had no breakfast, just nibbled some crackers and apples, so the fine dinner of roast turkey, cranberry sauce and ice cream did not go so bad.  As I sat there being served by colored waiters, I could hardly believe I had spent such a sleepless uncomfortable night as had just passed, had I not still been so weak and trembling.  When dinner was over we took a short nap and went out to see the sights in Santa Fe, the second oldest town in U.S.A.  There were Spaniards everywhere. We could not even inquire directions on the streets.  Finally I came to a Spanish school girl who could direct us.  It really seems a foreign city.  We went to the plaza to hear the band concert, after which we visited the oldest church in America, built in 1540.  Of course is was adobe, and near it stood a small adobe house said to be the oldest house in America.  It looked it.  We visited the Palace of the Governors, built in 1600.  It is now used for a museum, and contained many interesting relics of the Cliff Dwellers and Indians.  On ..... of the bad roads between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, Mrs Jordon and myself took the train.  We paid four cents per mile and then were charged 35c for a seat.  You pay for every thing you get in this country.  Albuquerque is a nice city, but I would not want to live there, as it is bounded on every side by the desert.  They had some very nice stores, with Spanish girls as clerks.  They have the handsomest depot I ever saw, and an equally handsome hotel, called the Alverado.  In Albuquerque we were fortunate in securing two furnished rooms, $5.00 per week.  We had a gas range, and all other conveniences of a modern house.  This would have been a delightful rest for me, had we not purchased milk at the near by grocery, that had been doped with formaldehyde.  Horace drank quite a little of this, and it was not long until he was a very sick child, being unable to keep even water on his stomach.  He was very sick for three or four days, until finally the doctor gave him peptonized milk.  From then on he recovered rapidly.  As soon as Horace was able, we continued our journey, after having spent a week in Albuquerque.  We packed our trunks in a box filled up the space with medical books, and had no more trouble from broken springs after we took the trunk off the back of the car.  I was quite happy that Sunday morning as we left Albuquerque, the sun was shining brightly, Horace was better, and I was anxious to reach my journeys end.  Had I known what was before me I would have been steeped in gloom.  The roads were not very well defined, so we soon got on a sand road, which used up our gas, although we did not know it until next morning.  We went about 15 miles on this road, before we decided we could not make it that way.  Then we went back and met a Mexican who directed us to Socorro.  We saw several coyotes but did not take time to molest them but finally one was so very impudent, that Dr. Jordon decided to shoot him and take his hide as a souvenir.  He was just climbing out from under the curtains of the auto, with the gun half cocked, and pointed at Kramer, when from some unknown reason, the gun went off shooting him through the leg, splintering the bone in three places.  Although I saw it done, I would not realize he was really shot until I heard his yell of pain.  Of course, Dr. Jordan felt terrible, but accidents will happen.  Remember I now had a sick baby and a wounded husband to look after.  Dr. Jordon hastily dressed the wound and we started on in hope of reaching a hotel, where we could make Kramer more comfortable.  Dr. Jordon now had to run the car, he was not used to running a Case car so it was very awkward for him, and we could make very little progress, however he did exceedingly well considering the experience he had.  Very soon we had a blow out, we had no inner tubs repaired, so my husband between groans tried to vulcanize some.  Mrs. Jordon assisted Fred in removing the tire, while I sat in the dusty road, trying to rock Horace to sleep.  I will never forget that scene as the moon came up, our teeth chattering with cold and our stomachs gnawing for food, we did not have the heart to eat supper.  Well, after the tube was vulcanized, Dr. and Mrs. Jordon almost wore themselves out trying to pump up the tires, for the pump would not work.  After two hours delay, we started on.  By-and-by we came to a Mexican house, where we might have staid all night, but we were a little afraid of Mexicans, and we wanted to get better accommodations for the doctor.  Very soon the car seemed not to be working right, so we decided to camp for the night.  The doctor took a good dose of morphine to ease his pain.  When morning came, and we were ready to start, on examining the tank, discovered we were out of gasoline.  We thought there must be a town a short distance ahead, so Dr. Jordon said he would go on and have some gas sent out.  As our water bag was about empty, Mrs. Jordon and I walked back hoping to get it filled.  We met a Mexican and his family with a barrel of water.  The gestures we made trying to make them understand that we wanted water, must have been amusing.  Noon came, then night, and no Dr. Jordon.  Not until seven the next morning did we hear lagging foot steps.  He had walked 20 miles the day before finding neither people nor houses.  It was five o'clock before he (Dr. Jordon) came to a ranch house only to find no body at home.  He quenched his thirst at a water tank and entertained serious thoughts of catching a chicken and devouring it raw.  The chickens had gone to roost so he was afraid to put his hands in for fear he might get caught in a trap so he starved it out.  He made friends with the dogs and tried to sleep with them but finding this too cold walked on five miles to some hay stacks where he staid until three o'clock the next morning when he started back to camp.  He was so weary he had to rest at intervals and his mouth was so dry he could not spit.  When he reached camp all we had to give him was some cold fried potatoes we had cooked the night before and were too heartsick to eat.  But Horace crawled onto his lap and they devoured them even if they were frozen.  You see when we left Albuquerque we expected to reach Socorro by night so did not take a supply for the long stay in the desert.  There was nothing for the rest of us to eat, some sugar and butter and cracker crumbs were all we had for Horace.  We had to drain water out of the radiator of the engine for him to drink.  Mrs. Jordon and I saw at once that we would have to go at once to get some gasoline and food.  We walked five miles meeting no body except Indians and Mexicans and, of course, could not talk to them.  Here we found a ranch house and an English boy who had stopped to water his horses and he talked for us to the Mexican ranchman.  We hired the Mexican to take us to the town of Scholey eleven miles away.  I filled the water bag with water and as the English boy was passing by our camp he promised to leave the water bag with the doctors.  I also asked him to sell enough crackers to the doctor for the baby until I could get back with provisions.  He gave them a box of crackers and about two pounds of cheese and would not take a cent of pay.  The boy would have taken us to Scholey but had other pressing business to attend to.  I cannot but smile when I think how we looked that day, riding to Scholey with the old fat Mexican, his skinny horses, and rickety old buggy, which I feared would collapse any minute.  Mrs. Jordon being rather fleshy insisted that I should ride with the Mexican while she rode on a little box behind.  It was about noon when we drove into Scholey &#8211; it was only a railroad station, no stores.  The young station agent sent the telegram for gas and we had to wait two hours and a half before we got an answer, saying that gas would be sent at once.  The agent very kindly sold us some of his groceries and we started for home.  It was a long tiresome ride and the sun went down before we reached camp.  The dust was fearful and we were shivering with cold as Mrs. Jordon had no coat and mine was very thin.  Kramer said "I never beheld such a welcome sight as to see us come riding in with the Mexican."  During our absence three autos had passed by.  They sold the boys gas and gave them plenty to eat, but as they had seen no signs of us ladies the doctors were very much alarmed.  We had gone off on a side road to reach this little town of Scholey, but our husbands were afraid something had happened to us in such a wild country.  They wanted to go on with the other autos but, of course, could not go without us.  That night about eight o'clock a chauffeur from the garage in Socorro brought us gas, having come 65 miles.  It cost us $23.00 to get us out of the desert.  Next morning as we were just ready to start two big automobiles from Chicago and bound for the coast came along.  We joined that party as we had found it did not pay to travel alone.  We had not traveled very far &#8211; only a few miles when Mr. McTavish's car was disabled with a broken spindle.  They decided to camp there while Mr. Brundage went on to the next town to telegraph for repairs.  We followed on, reaching the town of San Antonio.  Just before we reached this town we started to ford the Rio Grande river, had we followed our intention none of us would have been alive to tell the tale.  Then we went back and they told us we had to cross on the railroad bridge.  The next day was Thanksgiving day and we had a fine turkey dinner.  Kramer got only some scraps that night for supper, for he had to go back that morning to bring in Mrs. McTavish, Mrs. Brundage and her two children.  He was not really able to go, for his leg was very painful, but we felt we must do something to help them out of their difficulty.  We staid in this Mexican town about a week waiting for repairs to come for Mr. McTavish's car.  We then drove on to Socorro, Magdalena, and Datil's ranch, in the midst of a snow storm.  Dr. Jordon was very ill that night, and we were almost sick with fright lest he might be coming down with typhoid fever.  That night after the folks had gone to bed, I decided to go out to the auto for something.  The night was very dark and I only took some matches, and just as I struck one, I heard a racket as though there was some one in the auto.  I yelled Get out!  Ran back to the house and told Kramer there was some body robbing the auto.  He limped out the best he could on crutches, while I ran on ahead to tell the landlord to come.  When he came with his lantern, all we found was some bacon that had the corner chewed off, and cat tracks over the seat.  Right here I want to tell you, we were in a sheep country.  We were always offered mutton to eat.  I never before had condescended to eat it, but I did now, and found it very good indeed.  The next morning, the sun was shining brightly, and the snow melting rapidly.  Just as we were ready to start at ten o'clock, a chauffeur from Magdalena driving a Ford car came along, going to Springerville.  As Dr. Jordon was still ill we thought he had better go with the Ford man, so as to be sure to get a bed that night.  We were heavily loaded and the roads bad, so we thought possibly we might have to camp out.  We drove all that day through very beautiful snow covered mountains and large pine trees.  Imagine our surprise on meeting three large elephants and two camels on this lonely road.  Brundage's dog barked furiously at them.  The larger elephant we thought would have attacked us had he been able to budge the other two, which stood between him and our autos.  We discovered later that they belonged to a circus that was traveling that way.  We staid that night with some Mexicans in the town of Quemado.  The boy of the family acted as interpreter and we had very good accommodations.  After supper that night Horace got down and tried to play, but it had been so long since he had used his legs, he wobbled like a drunken man.  The next day we drove 54 miles over very rough roads to Springerville where we expected to find Dr. Jordon.  We reached the town, but could find no trace of him and his wife was nearly frantic.  By noon the next day we had heard nothing of him so Mr. Brundage decided to take his car and the doctor, a Mexican guide, and go in search of him.  About 5:30 they found Dr. Jordon and the Ford man stranded in the mountains without gas.  They had secured some naphtha, but it would not give them power enough to run up hill.  Mr. B. and Kramer had plenty of gas but they had their tank full of naphtha, and it would take about two hours to let it run out, so they hitched onto them with a long tow rope and were getting along fine, until they tried to go up a steep hill, where Mr. Brundage broke his car.  Then the Ford man drained his car and put in some good gas, while the doctors and Mr. Brundage built up a big fire, as it was 5 below zero and snowing.  Kramer, the Ford man, and the Mexican started back to Springerville, but their radiator had frozen and bursted, so they also slept on the mountain side in the snow, ten miles from the other men.  The next morning, the chauffeur and Mexican walked to Springerville.  The chauffeur took back our car with gas and repairs and all cars returned at 9 o'clock at night with whistles blowing.  Kramer had had nothing to eat for twenty four hours, and slept in the snow with only a lap robe for covering.  We spent about a week in Springerville, delayed by snow.  Dr. and Mrs. Jordon decided to stay here for awhile, and the rest of us with the three cars, left for Phoenix over the White mountains.  We traveled about fourteen miles to an old saw mill, camping there for the night.  We purchased beef from some cow boys and had some steak and gravy.  The cow boys baked some biscuits in an old Dutch oven and treated the crowd.  Our gasoline stove was the first these cow boys had ever seen.  It was too cold to sleep very much that night, as it was fifteen below zero, and it took us until noon the next day with fires around our autos before we could get them started.  One of the boys volunteered to act as guide for us over the mountains, and real glad we were to have him, for the snow hid all traces of the trail.  Once he hitched on to our car, and helped us over a steep place just as we were nearing the top of the mountain.  Sometimes we had to shovel away the drifts that we might get through.  That night we reached Cooley's ranch and camped in one of his houses, cooking our supper on an arm range.  Although a wealthy ranchman Mr. Cooley had an Indian squaw for his wife.  Next morning we traveled through the noted "Black Canon," but it was frozen and did not cause us the trouble it does some tourists.  From here we drove through forest, where trees would measure five feet in diameter and several hundred feet high.  About 4 p.m. we reached White River agency on the Apache Reservation.  They only asked us 70c per gallon for gasoline.  Right in the midst of the town there were several squaws chopping wood.  On inquiry we learned they were prisoners and had to do it.  Most of the Americans in this town were government employees.  We now started for Black River agency, passing Fort Apache at our left.  Just about dark we started down a steep mountain at the foot of which was White river.  After crossing this we climbed a mountain so steep we could only make about six feet at a pull.  We drove up, down, and around most dangerous mountain roads, reached Black River agency about 9 p.m. and camped in a buggy shed off a little store.  Next morning squaws arrived with little bundles of hay tied on burros, which they traded for groceries.  Mr. Brundage tried to take their pictures, they laughed and hid behind the auto.  We spent the day traveling over more rough roads and camped at a government saw mill.  Mr. Brundage drained the water from the radiators into a large dish pan, I was busy unpacking, and Kramer was cutting meat for supper, when we heard a scream, and found one of the ladies had set that pan of water on the floor, and the baby had backed into it.  First we thought him badly burned as he kept on crying.  We applied carbolic acid mixed with Vaseline, and in a short time he quieted down, and ate a good supper.  Next morning we had to pay one dollar per car to travel over the reservation.  As we passed along we saw many Indians and wondered how they could stand it to stay in their smoking teepees.  After driving over more rocky roads, we came to the small town of Rice.  Here we saw our first rail road train since having left Magdalena 250 miles behind us, two weeks before.  We camped here all night and left in the morning for Copper Globe, a mining town of about 10,000 population.  Here we secured a large supply of gas and started for Phoenix.  After traveling 40 miles over very good roads, we reached the great Roosevelt dam where we camped for the night.  Next morning we took a good look at the dam and departed.  Now we had the smoothest road any one ever had the privilege of traveling over.  There were mesquite brush on all sides, and cacti as large as trees.  As soon as we came to irrigated ranches, we saw all kinds of green things growing which looked good to us after traveling over such barren country so long.  While we were stopping in the pretty little town of Mesa, a rancher told the doctor about the new town of Chandler which was just started.  We were very much interested and promised to drive over and see it later.  We drove 16 miles to Phoenix reaching there after dark.  We secured a furnished room for $15.00 the month giving the doctor time to take the state board examination securing him the right to practice medicine in Arizona.  Phoenix is a rapidly growing city, and in winter is crowed with tourists.  There are many tubercular patients here.  We took great enjoyment in visiting the points of interest and were specially pleased to see oranges, grape fruit, almonds, lemons, figs, dates, and olives growing.  The school buildings are something grand.  On Friday of our first week in Phoenix, we motored to Chandler, we thought it the most beautiful location for a town we had ever seen.  We rented a house that was under construction which we purchased later.  Chandler is located in the Salt River Valley, surrounded on all sides by mountains.  It is watered from the Roosevelt dam, and deep wells.  One can hardly imagine this beautiful place one year ago, covered with mesquite brush and cacti and rattle snakes.  At present, we have a $150,000 hotel under construction, $8,000 depot, $16,000 school house, and a large bank building.  All of these buildings are brick covered with cement.  The doctors are building an office, costing $1,550.  All of these buildings are being built right now.  No, I am not tired of motoring, I would start on a trip this minute if I had a good chance, but no more winter trips for me.  Although our trip was hard in many ways, we saw many things of interest, and after finding such a lovely place to live, feel amply repaid.  Now friends, if you wish to come to the great golden West to make your home, we will gladly welcome you to Salt River valley.  Bessie Sanders Gilbert, Chandler, Arizona.</li>

<li id="c1315.2">[<a href="s8.htm#s488">S488</a>] William Roach (Bill) Gilbert's Recorded Life Story., The following story was originally recorded by Bill Gilbert, (William Roach Gilbert) probably in 1979 and 1981 at the request of Ethel Benham.  (Enid and Helen, her sisters, are also mentioned. He probably mis-spoke when he mentioned Helen, he meant to say Ethel.)  It was transcribed from four audio cassettes to the computer by Lee Kavaloski in late 1999 and finished up in January 2000.  It is difficult to take a spoken conversation, especially Bill's, and attempt to put it in correct punctuation.  In addition, Bill's original emphasis is entirely missing from this printed copy.  Bill often corrected his statements, and most of these corrections have not been retained.  In many places, the correct spelling of places or names can only be guessed at, a (?), or an alternate spelling, is usually included to indicate this uncertainty.  Bill had a habit of using the word "anyway" very often, many of these occurrences have not been retained. There are two endings to this story; Bill was probably not aware that the "second ending" was on the tape.  He probably thought he was recording on top of it.  Only a portion remains.  His story follows:  I was born November 8, 1908 in the very pretty little town of Sausalito in California.  I first saw the light of day in a charming home in Sausalito that Dad and Mother had built back in the 1890's.  I remember Dad talking about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 when he was in business in the McCall Building in San Francisco, and literally shaken out of his office.  Our home was not particularly damaged except the fireplace bricks came down, the piano was scooted across the room and a few other things to the effect that we did have to go out, the family did that is, go out and live in the wood shed out in back.  I think my earliest recollections were of being broke.  I sort of grew up in the time of a deep depression when Dad had been building a publishing and periodical business for some length of time, had changed that and had gone into sort of an inventive field where he had invented some type of a pump - a water pump - liquid pump, and also a water filter to fit on the faucet in the kitchen.  I can remember he had discovered that the way to hold a portion of that filter together - the only cement that he found that would really stick was melted sulphur, and I can remember in the kitchen of the house melting up pots of this melted sulphur to pour into these containers to purify water, and oh, the stink that it was!  Mother didn't care for it very much, but Dad - whatever he wanted to do, he did.  There was no ifs, ands or buts from Mother.  Dad, before I was born, had some sort of an interest in the Sausalito Water Company, where, at that time, there were springs throughout the hills and piped down to the individual water tanks which were located on everyone's individual property.  As a result of that, Dad, way before his time, had pipes all over the roof of our house with holes in those pipes where he could go out and turn on a valve and the entire sprinkler system would then operate.  That came to an end in my early youth because we were getting free water from that system and it watered all the garden and the whole place.  One day a Mrs. Hickelby(?) , a very wealthy widow who lived across the street from us in a mansion, either came over, or I went over there, I don't know, one of the two, and spilled the beans to the effect that it was a wonderful thing that we could water all of our yard for nothing.  Well, it happened to be she was either the owner or the director or the president of the water company, and it was her water that we were using.  Actually I think I was a pretty nasty little kid.  The immediate neighbors around had children my age, but they had money - the families had money even during the depression times.  I remember one time for Christmas, Dad asked me what I wanted for Christmas and times were pretty tight, and I knew they were, whether I wanted a bicycle or a little red wagon.  Well I didn't answer that same day, but the next day I thought it all over during the night, and I knew that a bicycle cost quite a lot of money, and that a little red wagon did not.  I chose the red wagon.  In order to get some money in my own pocket, I guess I was one of the starters of the original garage sale.  Out in front of our house was a fairly level place on a corner of the road, and I had gathered up all of my toys or one thing or another that I had, and some of the things that Mother donated, and one thing or another, and I set up a store, ostensibly to raise money.  (Telephone rings in background.)  You probably just heard the telephone in the background.  It was the nurse in the doctor's office telling me that I had to go back to Marin General Hospital for another operation on prostate, which will be on Wednesday, the 23rd at 2:30.  I'm not very happy about the entire thing, but I know it has to be done.  The streets were not paved then in Sausalito, and somehow or other I had acquired a bicycle, and I can remember riding the bike around the streets of Sausalito along with some of my friends.  Sausalito was, and is, mostly hills, and I soon found that a bicycle was of not to great a value when it came down to pushing the darn bike up to the top of the hill again.  Finally the great day arrived, I imagine it was around 1920 or 21, when the Sausalito fathers decided, and a bond issue passed, that the streets of Sausalito would be paved.  Well the first one to be paved, of course, was Water Street, now called Bridge Way, at the bottom of the hill.  And subsequently the other streets were paved of course, to a certain extent they were paved, with what we call a water cure.  At that time, (driving a tractor), we took into our home a young man by the name of Stanley Jones - a handsome guy.  He was driving one of the construction tractors, and he lived with us, oh I guess, it was all during one summer, until he went back to the University of California for his studies and subsequent graduation.  He stayed with us during that time, and also afterwards, when he got a job at the Radio Corporation of America in San Francisco as a stock clerk.  I saw him a couple of times.  As a matter of fact, the reason I saw him was to go over and try to borrow money for our family to eat on - which I don't know if I got or I didn't.  Dad never gave me any real money to use to play with, because he didn't have any.  I think at this time he was selling electric cookers, the pre-runner of the electric stove, to the hardware merchants up and down California.  I was old enough to drive then, and he bought a new model T Ford Roadster to travel the roads, and I was the chauffeur.  Dad could drive, but he would drive the same as he would have driven a team of horses - expecting the car to do exactly what it was supposed to do, without any real help from him.  I believe at this time he also had a line of schoolbooks.  I think it was called the World Book, that he was selling to the elementary schools and such sales necessitated meeting the Board of Directors and so forth, to get them to buy this World Book.  I think it was $100 or $200 - for the schools.  Well, evidently he made ends meet, but that was just about all.  Dad loved me - I know he did, but remember, I was the junior by 18 years of my older sister, Mildred Louise, whom I called "Itty".  That's another story, but I might as well hit it now.  A man from China - a Scotsman - a very personable individual, somehow or other got to know my sister and got to know us, our family and he came to live in our house.  He was working at the time, in the office of Belford Guthrie(?) & Company in San Francisco.  He was born in New Zealand and raised on the mainland in China going to a private English school, The Way Hiway School, about 600 miles up the coast from Shanghai.  He got to know my sister quite well.  A matter of fact, so well, that eventually they got married.  But that's another story.  He went back to China and brought back with him, way ahead of his time, some harvesting machinery to machine harvest the rice in the rice paddies.  While they were there - my sister, his wife, and he went way up the Yangtze on trips.  I don't know if it was for pleasure or business, but traveling on junks, they got up into portions of Northern China where no white woman had ever been seen before.  So my sister's letters and accompanying photographs were very, very elucidating.  Mac McFarland was his name, and he had gone back to China, alone.  He had to - and I still have a postcard he had written from Woohoo(?),  which was a town abut 300 miles up the Yangtze River and pointing out the house he had picked out for his bride if she would come over and marry him.  My sister did.  She went on the steamship China, went over to China, and they were married and evidently had a very happy, lovely, first year of marriage.  My sister became pregnant and while giving alms to a beggar woman on the street, (at least that's the way they figure it), she caught small pox and subsequently died.  The peculiar thing about the smallpox disease is that there are many, many strains of smallpox, and although she had been vaccinated in a private school in Chicago, vaccinated when she graduated from Stanford University, and also before she went to China, nevertheless, evidently it was another strain, and she died and is buried on Bubbling (Bubbly?) Well Road in Shanghai.  Evidently her death hit Mac, her husband, very, very hard because all the possessions she had gathered in the year over there - incidently she spoke Chinese, and she was always interested in the Oriental art - and all the things they had purchased for their home; the rugs, furniture, figurines - everything was shipped back to our home on Sunshine Avenue in Sausalito.  I don't remember whether Mac ever came back and sought consolation with my mother and father or not.  I do know and I can remember these boxes arriving from China and opening them and putting the furniture and so forth in our own home.  I look back on it now, and I see that I never received very much discipline from either of my parents.  I know they both loved me, but I was simply a tag-along kid - and I was sort of around and sort of got into Dad's hair, I think, on many occasions.  I do know that my sister was the apple of their eyes, and when she died, something really and truly died in our family.  I must remember that while my sister was growing up as a young girl, Dad had money in those days.  He was, I think, the head of a publishing firm or selling the Encyclopedia Britannica or something of that sort.  But there was money and she was able to go to the private schools and finally went to, as I said before, Stanford and graduated from there.  I remember upon her graduation, I guess there was still money in the family and Dad presented her with a trip to Alaska on one of the Alexandria boats in those days, a tour trip and she had a wonderful time. It also commemorated the time when she had recovered from an influenza attack, and it was a very, very bad one, in which all of her hair fell out.  It subsequently grew back in again.  She had a grand time on that trip.  Which the pictures I have, which she had taken and taken by other people, will attest.  Well, I went along the usual way, I guess, of kids.  I went through the grammar schools, walking quite a few miles to school.  Looking back on it now, none of today's children would ever walk that far.  I graduated from primary school and went up to Tamalpais High School.  I guess it was about that time that I had a very bad case of acne vulgaris, in which there were huge sores on the back and chest and some on my face.  And the first time....  (Space in tape, end of first side of first tape)  in a mediocre hotel room in Sacramento that Dad noticed these sores on my front and back.  I can remember how terribly put out that he was that a child of his could have that type of thing.  So I remember the next day he disregarded all business and we came back to San Francisco and he took me over to a doctor's office - Doctors Morrow, Miller and Tausig, who were the great skin specialists at that time in San Francisco - for me to start taking treatments.  I know they were expensive and I know that Dad never paid for them because I can remember the bill collectors coming around trying to get the money out of him after the treatments were discontinued.  They were pretty rough.  The usual lancing and so on and so forth, but also they used what was called an Alpine light treatment and x-rays, which I know now, but did not for many, many years know, that that made me sterile.  I never did completely get over that thing and still have a few of them now.  However, that is not really to the point.  I didn't like High School and I didn't like any type of discipline.  I didn't like anybody to tell me - No, you can't do that - because I certainly would go right out and do it.  Finally, it was in my junior year, or perhaps the first of the senior year, I don't know, I got mixed up in a party in Mill Valley in a house belonging to people who had gone to San Francisco for their winter living.  The girl used to commute from San Francisco to continue her studies at Tamalpais High School.  Going up on the electric train in the morning she was on there, and also, of course, a whole bunch of kids from San Francisco and Sausalito, and we decided the heck with school that day and we would go up to her home in Blythdale Canyon in Mill Valley and have a party.  Well of course this was during prohibition days, and several gallons of dago red or red wine were there at the party.  There must have been around 15 of us, I don't know.  But a worldly wise next door neighbor, hearing all of the racket going on in the house, and of course this was on a school day, phoned the Tamalpais High School.  The hooky cop, Russell was his name, Mr. Russell.  He had a Model T Ford coupe.  He came up and banged on the door and everybody vanished, except myself and I think there were one or two others who were really drunk.  I wasn't.  I didn't know enough to drink.  I didn't know enough anyway.  I didn't know enough - period.  So, he grabbed me and took me down to Sausalito to my mother and presented my mother with this her, individual!  I don't remember Mother's reaction completely, but of course I was very, very embarrassed and the world was against me.  I was alright, but the world was all against me.  So I packed the few clothes I had.  I had a car then, a Model T Ford of some sort - I don't know what it was - what kind it was - it was a Model T,  I know that.  I went over across the bay to Tiburon and I got a job with an Italian landscape artist, as he would be called today.  In those days he was simply a gardener.  He took care of many of the homes on Corinthian Island, Belvedere and some in Tiburon, although Tiburon was a railroad town in those days.  I know I was paid $2.00 a day.  I think it was a 10-hour day to do the usual gardening things - pick and shovel and all the rest.  I enjoyed it - it was fine.  I lived in the upstairs - it was kind of a rooming house - the H & H Caf&#233;, operated by some colored people, who were some of the finest in the world - really.  The mother was named Hazel, the last name was Hunt, and the father was named Percy.  I remember in the little cubicle room I had, I had some books I could read.  Every morning about 5 o'clock - in that same place there were about half a dozen recalcitrant youths working either on the railroad, or gardening or somewhere - we would get up and run across the Tiburon Street and take a dive in the bay, naked of course, and come on back and eat a very hardy breakfast and Mrs. Hunt would have prepared a box lunch for us and we would go off to work.  It was a great time, as a matter of fact.  I was drinking a good deal - most of the time.  I had a hell of a time - getting into fights and a few other things.  But then I realized at the end of the summer that that was no place for me and that wasn't the kind of a life I was going to lead.  So I came back to Tamalpais and Mr. Ernest T. Wood, who was the principal.  I made my wishes known to him and told him I would be a good boy if I could come back and complete my education.  I don't know what he said - Oh, I do remember.  He said, "If you keep on going the way you are, you're going to end up in the penitentiary - that's all there is to it."  Well, that struck me kind of hard.  But anyway, I made up my mind - I was going to finish school - so I did.  I graduated from Tamalpais High School and my very good friend, David Eldridge, whom I played around with in a very nice way - he never got mixed up in any of my troubles - we graduated together and our folks were there, probably thanking God and somebody else for my graduation.  Then I went along to- I think it was about the second or the third class in a school called Marin Junior College, now known as the College of Marin, and a very, very large and fine institution having two campuses, as the modern day age is.  And I buckled down there for the first six or seven months.  My studies were pretty good.  I remember I took Spanish, and the Spanish teacher, a Viola Evans, a very charming young woman, was living with us in our house in the downstairs portion.  She had a room and bath and so on, in order to defray some of the expenses and bills.  This was of course still during prohibition.  I was elected student body president.  Why I don't know, but I was.  And the drinking was pretty good.  We had the botany labs and the laboratories and we would steal the alcohol out of the labs and replace it with water and go across the street to the little Italian store and buy cream soda and something of that sort and mix them together and have quite a good gin drink, or at least an alcohol drink.  As I look back now, I guess that was really the start of my drinking, and which I now call alcoholism, and I never stopped drinking from then until about four years ago.  Anyway, I graduated from Marin Junior College and during that time I became enamored with a girl.  I guess it was just after I graduated - she lived in San Rafael.  I moved out bag and baggage from Sausalito and moved to San Rafael into her house.  I got a job working on paving the streets in San Rafael.  We used to drive a truck and pick up the gutter boards after they were pulled off of the forms of the gutters, and so on.  Sort of a roustabout.  Well, dad, by that time, had an office in San Francisco in the Call (Coral?) Building, and he had gone to San Francisco one morning, and unbeknownst to him, they had varnished the floors in his office.  He walked in with his rubber heels on the new varnish, slipped, fell and broke his hip.  Well in those days they didn't put a pin and plate in, they put you in a body cast from head to toe and kept you there until the thing was healed.  This necessitated about six or seven months with Dad in bed flat on his back.  It didn't make any difference to me, I moved out anyhow, went to San Rafael and left Mother to take care of Dad.  I was a cold, callous individual, I guess.  Mother then, in order to make ends meet, somehow or other, took out a Real Estate license.  In those days it wasn't much to get a license - you simply asked for one, paid your 5 bucks or 10 bucks and got a license - which she did.  She walked up and down those Sausalito hills day after day showing and selling property.  Never made a big success, but she made enough to keep body and soul together.  Dad got well from his hip and went back to the office and tried to work, I don't know for how long.  And then he became quite ill.  We had no money - they had no money - we had no money.  He was taken to Ross General Hospital, where he died as a ward of the county.  Supposedly from liver trouble, but I think he just naturally died from despondency and gave up.  He died in my arms.  Anyway, Mother was then left alone in Sausalito, living in this big house, and she took in boarders.  She was getting along.  In the meantime, I got married to this gal in San Rafael and through the good offices of her mother, got a job with the Manning Coffee Company in San Francisco.  My first job with them was as a pearl diver in a little place on Powell Street where the turntable - the trolley turntable was.  It was a restaurant.  I was watched by Mr. Manning and also was sort of a fair haired boy to learn the business.  So I was taken out of there and put in several of what was at that time called their dry coffee stores.  I ended up in the Crystal Palace Market - a huge big public market, way up on Market Street and I was working there six days a week - 12 hours a day for a very good salary of $30.00 a week, shoveling out the dry coffee which was roasted and blended that morning, brought it up to the stores.  The people bought this dry coffee from the bins and we turned around and put it through the grinder and ground it for them to whatever grind they wanted and they had really a wonderful, wonderful coffee.  I worked there, I guess, about a year, maybe year and a half, I don't know, until they transferred me to Oakland.  At this time I was married, living in San Rafael in my mother in-law's house, paying no rent, with my wife.  My wife was helping my mother-in-law because she had different contracts with some of the schools for their school lunches and she also had boarders in the house.  And she also had a husband who was blind.  He had been a dentist, but he was confined to a wheelchair and she had to take care of him.  So I was transferred to Oakland and there was nothing to do but my wife and I moved to Oakland.  I couldn't stand to commute over to Oakland, so we moved over there.  We got a little house, I think it was $20.00 a month.  Lovely little house, way out by Mills College.  That time we met a boy by the name of Jack Tate who also worked at the Manning Company and who lived about a block away from where I did.  He was just recently married.  He had an old Dodge.  I had a big Marmon at that time.  Which incidently was taken later on because I didn't make the payments on the darn thing.  He worked for the Manning Coffee Company, and so did I, and I used to ride back and forth to work with him.  Drinking was going pretty good at that time because it was over there in Oakland prohibition was repealed.  Now I remember the first booze that came on the market legitimately was a brand of bourbon called Crab Orchard. Well Crab Orchard and I became very, very good friends.  My mother-in-law had the idea of taking the big estate in San Rafael, which was vacant, had about 15 or 16 rooms in it or more - I don't know.  Huge, great big living room, so she thought it would be a good idea to start a restaurant and boarding house.  This was in the residential section of San Rafael, right behind the Catholic church.  So she and I talked it over, and I said "Yeah".  So I quit my job and came to San Rafael.  We started the place on what we thought was Laurel Avenue, so we called the place the Laurel Inn.  Well, actually it was a success from the stand point of people coming there.  My mother-in-law was an excellent, excellent cook.  My wife was pretty good, and by that time, I had become pretty good.  So I personally built on, by hand, with another guy that came down, George Marsh was his name, we built on a big dining room which had been sort of a portico, where the horses used to drive up in their carriages.  And we could seat about 200 people there - that is at banquet tables.  But of course most of the time we had just individual tables with candlelight and so on around the whole room. We used to have the Business and Professional Women, the Kiwanis Club, Lions Club - all the clubs would meet there for their luncheons.  We also catered to wedding receptions, bridge teas and social events. Well, we were working awfully hard, I mean by hard - boy - it was 12 days a week, you know - and we also had boarders in the house, which paid the nut and....  (Space in tape, end of first tape)  ...entire time, four years.  It was pretty miserable for me inasmuch as my mother-in-law was pretty much of a - well - things had to be her way, and she was an indomitable worker.  Oh terrific!  So was I.  So was my wife and so was my wife's sister, Kathleen.  Anyway, for four years, my wife and I were never man and wife.  Finally I could stand it no more and I told her that she would have to go to a doctor, a Dr. China Perry, a woman doctor in Sausalito, whom I knew, to find out what was the matter, whether it needed a hospitalization or what.  She was never very anxious about the entire thing anyway.  She thought it was a bunch of hooey.  But she did.  She went down and had the examination.  Afterwards Dr. China Perry called me on the telephone and said, "Bill, you can do one of two things.  Either hit your wife over the head with a rolling pin and rape her, or get a divorce."  Well, the love that I had for my wife during those four years had pretty much diminished.  So the next morning I packed my bag - that's all it was.  Although a lot of the furniture in the house, in the big place had gotten from my mother and from here and there.  I walked down the front stairs and went back to Sausalito to live with my mother.  I've never seen my first wife to this day since.  I understand she had been married, and had children, and was fine and dandy.  That was a past.  I got a divorce.  Never paid the attorney for it.  I think it was $25.00 or $30.00.  But never had the money to pay for it.  I took out a real estate license and went to work with my mother who at that time had an office in Sausalito.  Well, I'm forgetting some parts of this story, and will have to go back and revive it.  The last year I was in high school and the subsequent years in Junior College, I also got a job as a bartender in a speakeasy in Sausalito.  As a matter of fact, this is a side story.  I was working with a very, very nice guy who never smoked, drank or told dirty jokes, I guess.  And everything was fine until one evening - I think it was around 5 or 6 o'clock - no it was later than that - 7 or 8 o'clock because the commute rush was over.  We used to charge 15 cents for a shot then in those days.  The cigar box buzzer rang, and I let the people in, and two guys came to me at the bar and said "Is your name Gilbert?"  And I said, "Yes, it is."  And they said, "Well come on with us, and they pulled out identification, silver star, gold star, something, which identified them as Secret Service - Federal.  I told him we made all our payoffs, there was no real trouble.  And he said, "We're not here on the booze thing at all.  Lock up the joint and come on."  I said, "Can I make a call?"  They said "No, you can't make a call - you come right now."  So I locked up the joint, went with them, one on each side of me and they took me to San Francisco.  Well, what happened - the guy that I was working behind the bar with - all the time was Baby Face Nelson, and he was on the hide-out there.  I remembered then that he had borrowed George's - the owner of the bar - car to go down to Los Angeles - to take a quick trip down.  He had some business down there.  But in so doing, he took my hat off of the rack, and took my hat with him on this trip.  Well my hat was - maybe a month later, I don't know when it was - some time it was found back in a bank in Elgin, Illinois that Johnny Chase had just robbed.  And I think he killed somebody or something too.  So my hat was found there and from the initials in the hat and the store it was bought, they traced it all the way back to me.  So I spent about 3 - 4 hours under those lights in that Federal Building.  Some of the roughest time.  They didn't hurt me or anything.  Just the light and questions.  Anyway they finally decided that nope, I was clear.  They didn't even bring me home.  They didn't even give me carfare.  I had four bits or six bits in my jeans - got on the ferry boat and came on home.  But while I was in the speakeasy working there, of course I got to drinking a lot too.  A kid. Great thing. There was no such thing as marijuana or dope - if there was I never heard of it.  But drinking was the start of my downfall, I guess.  So, now to go back, that was just one story there in the vast background.  When I finally came down to live with my mother in the house on Sunshine Avenue, I worked in the real estate office.  That was fine.  We were renting them places, nice homes down there for $25.00 - $35.00 - $45.00 a month.  Anything you could.  The foreclosures were terrific.  Nobody had a deposit receipt.  Nobody had a listing agreement.  There was nothing.  You did have a license and you had an office.   There were only three of us who had offices in Sausalito at that time.  As a result of the four years of marriage - so called - when I came down to Sausalito, any girl was fair game.  And I guess I kind of turned the town upside down and around.  I made a little money in the real estate office - enough to keep body and soul together.  And I did make two big deals at that time, they really were.  Made the papers and so on.  Which meant getting together in one particular deal, five different sets of properties by one owner under the trusteeship of the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco.  I found five buyers for it, and we put the whole damn thing together.  And got quite a name for myself as the town wonder boy and so on.  Was going to run for Council and then didn't.  But more and more it was the drinking.  It was in those days that I met my present wife.  We both drank a lot.  She was working for the San Francisco Chronicle at the time, living in San Francisco.  No - she'd come to Sausalito, by Joe, that's right.  And that's where I met her.  She and her sisters and some others - sort of a groupie - sort of a house.  But not sexy - but groupie.  I rented it to them, anyway, I think I did, anyway.  Anyway I got to know her and we started going together, drinking at different bars, one of which is now the Valhalla, which in those days was simply a bar.  And the Four Winds and several others, and Smitty's.  I also was selling insurance.  Supposedly the premiums on the insurance was to pay the nut for the house and the rent and so on.  Well, we had no money.  Mother and I had no money.  Gosh if you had $2.00 in your pocket in those days you were a king.  Dad, before he had died, had taken out a second mortgage on the house.  I think it was only $4,000 or something of that sort.  We also had a first mortgage.  Through the Eureka Building Savings and Loan.  Now when Roosevelt came in, he declared a moratorium on all foreclosures.  So at that time - I forget the red tape of the thing - but we couldn't make our payments to the Savings and Loan, but they couldn't touch us.  It was the Home Owner's Bank or the Home Owner's Loan or something - I don't know what the red tape was - But we got out of that.  But we - Mother and I could not get out of that second mortgage.  And it came due and it had to be paid.  Well, the mortgage was owned by a man over in the East Bay - and oh how I hated that man - only by name.  He was justifiably within his rights.  He foreclosed on the mortgage and evicted us.  So, mother and I went through the aid of a good friend of hers, and rented a very nice little apartment - not an apartment - place was an old house, and we lived very comfortably.  I think our rent was around $25.00 a month again.  PG&E bills and such were very, very low, so there was no overhead.  So if we made $100 a month - why fine, we were doing alright.  About that time the Golden Gate Bridge started to be built.  So I got a job at the Golden Gate Bridge as a night watchman on the Marin Tower.  Which meant I used to have to walk up - they were spinning the cables then, walk up the cat walk or the cable whichever it was, to the top of the Marin Tower at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and stay up there.  In the middle of the night I had to walk down the center span and check in with the usual time clock, because they were afraid of fire on the bridge.  Where I was on the top was a little shack and there were storage shacks around full of oil and grease and creosote and rope and things of that sort, which if they ever caught fire, being right over the cable, would have taken the temper away from the steel in the cable and everything would have been a mess.  So that's what I was up there for.  I came down at 8 o'clock the next morning, came down in an elevator.  They had an elevator running on the outside of the tower at that time for the workmen.  My job also was to catch the people who had been drinking in San Francisco and thought it was a good idea to walk the cables up the top of the Golden Gate Bridge and down to Sausalito.  Well I caught two or three of them up there.  By the time they got to the top, of course, they'd had their shoes off and they were sober by the time they got up there, and scared to death.  I had a phone up there and I would call the cops.  I tell them I would keep them there and I had coffee.  The next morning they would come down the elevator with me and the cops would take them away.  Social people and one thing and another - nuts.  I don't know what happened on that job.  I don't know if I got fired or reduction in force or if the bridge was finished, or what the hell.  But anyway I quit the job and got away from it.  At the same time I had the job up there on the bridge, I was still working in the real estate office.  Making some money - a little bit.  Now I was selling insurance alright, some of it - all kinds, but in those days the insurance agent I think had 60 days in which to turn in the premium he had collected for the sale of the insurance.  Turn it into the company.  I represented half a dozen different companies - one of which was the Travelers.  I sold a terrific - in those days terrific - life insurance policies to some very prominent and some very wealthy people, who paid their premium right on the dot.  Well, I got to drinking of course, as usual, and spent that money, along with other monies.  Anyway, I owed $500- $600 in different premiums to different companies.  And I couldn't pay any of it.  So this was in 1940.  The real estate business wasn't very good.  It could have been, I suppose, if I had worked at it - but I didn't.  And between the drinking and one thing and another.  The least mentioned.  I owed this money and I couldn't pay it so I thought - well, I think there is a war coming on.  I had seen and I knew of the ships loaded with scrap iron and everything else going over to China from San Francisco.  And I knew that things back in Washington D.C. weren't very hot, although I revered President Roosevelt with a great reverence, I still do.  I felt there was something going to happen, and there was a good chance to get the hell out.  So I sat down and wrote letters to all my creditors - not all - there was about five or six of them - I guess - insurance companies.  I told them I was responsible and that it was me all the way through.  That these people had paid their premiums and they were entitled to their insurance.  And I had simply absconded with the money.  Well that didn't exactly clear my spirits, but it cleared it in my mind.  And it cleared the people who had the insurance from having to come back and pay it again.  So I got into a rattletrap Buick that I owned at that time and I drove down - oh, before that I saw my girlfriend, whose name was Wenonah.  Her last name was O'Brien.  My first wife's last name was O'Connor.  So I was kind of mixed up with the Irish.  I drove down to Moffitt Field and parked the car somewhere and left it.  I also wrote the credit company who owned the car, actually, where they could pick the damned thing up.  I went in and I joined the United States Army Air Corps.  I figured that was the safest place for me.  I didn't have enough brains to become a pilot and I was too old anyhow.  So I knew there was some administrative place somewhere I could get into in the Air Corps.  So I did.  I was sworn into the Air Corps and they gave me three choices.  "Well, Private Gilbert you can go down to Clark Field in Manila immediately.  You can go to Hickam Field over in Hawaii, or you can go to Ft. Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah."  And I thought, well, I don't think I want to get out of the country just yet.  I think I'll stick at home and went to Ft. Douglas, Utah.  So I guess it was the next day, they put me on a train, tickets and so forth, and sent me to Ft. Douglas, Utah.  This was in October 1940.  Well, I got up there in the middle of the night and there was someone there to meet me in a government truck, and oh, my gosh.  At the time, the U.S. government did not have the facilities.  They weren't prepared for the volunteer and the draft that came in like a deluge.  This was a tent city perched on the slope of a hill.  It was October then and winter time in Ft. Douglas and Salt Lake city, and there was snow everywhere.  We were in tents, there were four of us to a tent.  Concrete floor and what they called a "Sibley" stove, which was like an inverted thimble or funnel, in which we were given green wood to burn to keep warm.  Well, boy you couldn't keep warm.  It was cold.  And we had some drills, of some sort out in front, and I thought this is not for me.  So when the call came down from the big First Lieutenant who was the company commander, and wanted to know if anybody in his command could cook.  And I said, "yeah, I can."  Well, I was a pretty good cook, as a matter of fact.  What it meant to me was warmth.  Plenty of warmth and plenty to eat.  That was right up my alley.  The cook house was - the government had taken over an old CCC Conservation Corp. Camp which was long green painted barracks.  Some of the men were living in those.  Some were in the tents where we were, but the mess halls were in these barracks.  The mess hall was.  I don't know how many men there were - about 1,000.  So I went into the kitchen.  And that was fine - that was great.  Plenty to eat, nice and warm, and for my tent buddies, why, they didn't have to go to the mess hall.  At the end of the day of course I was always scavenging something - a turkey or some chickens or steaks or something.  Anyway I would bring them back to the mess tent and we would have a real good feast.  Christmas 1940 we had all those turkeys, so we roasted the turkeys and we had the meal.  I solicited the aid of a companion.  He helped me.  He had the cranberry sauce, and all the fixings, and I had the whole damn big turkey.  So I bought the whole turkey back to this tent and believe me the four of us really feasted on that turkey that night.  Somebody had gotten up enough money to go down to Salt Lake where the liquor could be bought, all you wanted at the liquor stores owned by the state.  The bars were simply beer bars.  Again, that's where I was doing plenty of drinking and plenty of eating.  I had a good time.  In those days the men were coming in so damn fast and they couldn't take care of them properly.  I was a good cook, and so they promoted me, first to, no I never made corporal, I came from a private, right directly to sergeant, mess sergeant.  Well I decided I was going to run a good mess hall, or else, and I did.  Then we moved up from the tents to the old Ft. Douglas barracks up on top of the hill - great big stone and brick buildings with steam heat and everything was really comfortable - through the winters, it was marvelous.  Well, it wasn't marvelous, but it was damn good anyway for those days.  I remember one of the pay checks I got.  You came into the orderly room all dressed in your best uniform, your garrison cap in your hand upside down and you hold it out to the paymaster, usually a Second Lieutenant and the First Sergeant, and they'd count the money out and put it in the top of your cap.  Well, I looked at my money and it was $3.20.  I though, Holy Christmas.  So I took the $3.20 now the rest of it - I was making $21.00 a month, the rest of it went for haircuts, tickets at the post exchange where I bought cigarettes and one thing or another, and I had used up all but the $3.20.  So that was my pay.  I had a camera, a Voitlander.  It was a good one.  And I took it down to the hock shop and I think I got $15.00 bucks for it.  Well I was pretty wealthy then with $18.00 in my pocket.  So there was the usual playing around with that amount of money in a drunken bucket of blood called the Old Heidelberg in Salt Lake City.  While I was a mess sergeant there, a Captain Vance, I think his name was, was going to fly an Old DC3, which was a 3 motor Ford plane, down to California, Sacramento to McClelland Field and he wanted to know if there was anybody wanted a ride and I said - Hell Yes!  So I got on and had a free ride down to McClelland Field and also over to Hamilton Field and from there to Marin County, and there I called my girl, Wenonah, in San Francisco, and had a good telephone talk.  We got back on the plane and coming home going over the Sierra we felt kind of a bump, and didn't think too much of it until we landed in Salt Lake City.  We went out and looked and on the radio wire, which was a single wire stretching fore and aft, there was this branch of a pine tree.  That's how low we were coming across the hump.  Then we heard they were going to open up a new field in Boise, Idaho to be called Gowan Field, and the advance cadre was to be supplied by Ft. Douglas in Utah.  So I made my application, or maybe I was told - I don't know, that I would be on that advance cadre to open up this Gallon Field in Boise, Idaho.  I was getting a little tired of Salt Lake City and all the snow anyhow, although I finally found out there is just as much snow in Boise Idaho as there is in Ft. Douglas, Utah.  So we got up there and everything was new and everything was great.  They had what is called a consolidated mess, which fed 4,000 troops.  Well, I made Tech Sergeant or Staff Sergeant, one of the two.  And I was put in charge of this mess.  Well, the cooks had a separate room of their own, and I, as a Mess Sergeant had a real separate room of my own, and I was in seventh heaven.  I tried so hard to make that a good mess that I got a cot and put it in the office in the mess hall and I was there 24 hours a day.  And we had a good mess.  I even....  (Tape Space, end of first side, second tape)  ...that their sons were getting.  In those days, before the war started, the mess Sergeant was able to go down to the green grocers in the morning, and select his own crates of green groceries, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. and then go over to the slaughter house, and taking the veterinarian with him, picking out the different carcasses that he wanted for his mess halls.  Every time I had three or four crates or maybe ten crates or twenty of lettuce or something that would come in.  One of the crates would have a red X on it and there would be one or two or maybe three bottles of booze.  So I was kept supplied with booze pretty well.  The reason I came in to take over this so called consolidated mess hall was that the prior mess sergeant was really ripping off.  He had established himself in a little town called Nampa as a green grocer, as a wholesaler.  So he and the mess hall would right up - I must interpose this however, that a mess officer never knew what the hell he was doing - that was the lousiest job for an officer to have.  And usually some stoop got it who didn't know anything about nothing.  So, this Mess Sergeant would write out orders for ten crates of lettuce, and two of beets and this and that and so forth, and then he would also write out his acceptance receipts for the food that never did come into the mess hall.  Never - there wasn't any at all.  And the government would pay out the money and send it to a box in Nampa and then he would have all this money.  Well I soon got a hold of that, found out what was going on, and I don't know whether he's still breaking rocks down in Virginia or somewhere or not, but anyway, he's out.  He was an old -timer.  He knew the ropes, but he just knew one rope a little too far.  So anyway, I was serving good meals in this mess hall and everything was great.  And then they promoted me to Master Sergeant.  All this was between October 1940 and, I guess, about June 1941.  Somewhere in there. Those promotions came awfully fast.  So I had good money, good job, plenty to eat and I was in high heaven.  And plenty of booze, which was also high heaven.  One night, Pearl Harbor night - by that time I had established a salvage deal whereby all the cooks - and I had 30 or 40 of them, or more - I don't know - get together and save the crates that the oranges would come in, the sacks the potatoes would come in.  They were all fairly clean, folded nicely, and all put together.  The crates weren't broken up.  At that time, the Army was buying - I was buying, the half carcasses of meats and the bones would be rendered down, the fat would be rendered out and I had all these G.I. garbage cans loaded either with bones or rendered fat.  I would get a truck and take them up to the slaughter house, which was about 12 miles out or town.  A regular slaughter house where they had dead horses, pigs, and everything else.  I would sell this grease and bones and all the rest of the stuff to these people, and established a slush fund.  I kept half of it, and the other half went into a legitimate slush fund and once a month we would throw a party.  Well, this was on the eve of Pearl Harbor.  It was before Pearl Harbor had happened - Saturday Night I guess it was.  We went down to a little town called Mountain View which was about 12 -15 miles south of Boise.  There was an Air Base there too, but I don't know if it had started then or not, probably a little later it was.  In the town was a big house of ill repute.  So I had about 15 or 20 of these guys - these cooks - with me and I paid all the expenses and they had all the fun with the girls, and I was drinking - oh boy - so we got scraps and fights and one thing or another.  We had two six-by trucks.  And I was sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and shooting the fat with the Madam, and all the guys were playing around, and over the radio we had going there, was the call - All men return to base immediately - We are at War - We have been attacked.  Well, that was the only message.  Well believe me, I had some time at 1 - 2 o'clock in the morning getting these guys together, swinging them over my shoulder and all the rest of it, getting them back into the trucks and getting them back to Gowan Field, Boise, Idaho.  Well of course the scare was on.  Everybody that could walk was carrying a gun and walking sentry duty, and digging fox holes and all the damn fool things.  We thought - the powers thought - that the Japanese having attacked Pearl Harbor were going to attack the West Coast, and ours being one of the largest training air fields on the West Coast or in the mountains, we were going to get it.  So for two or three days there things were pretty scary.  Of course there were no Japs.  But we thought of saboteurs and all the rest of it.  Anyway that scare got over and things got back to normal.  We were at war.  We had a reason to be then.  There was a new feeling throughout all the base.  Ours was a base for the B-25's,  B-26's and then also B-17's for their last transitional training before they went overseas.  The crews that is.  I developed the idea that these crews - these flight crews and the ground maintenance crews were working 24 hours a day.  At least they were always open in their shops.  So I should keep, and I would keep, those mess halls open 24 hours a day.  Anybody that had a legitimate reason to come in and eat and drink - coffee I mean - could.  So I got a commendation from the old man on the base for doing that.  Everything went fine until somebody looked into my service record.  Now I was a Master Sergeant then, and had things pretty much my way.  So the orderly came from the old man's office - it was a Colonel called Kane, by the way, who had done a wonderful job on the Ploiesti Oil Fields over in Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia or somewhere flying from Africa.  He was the old man, and he was a tough son-of-a-gun.  Young man.  So I was to go over and see him.  So I got on my horse and went over and saw him. He said, Mr. Gilbert, no not Mr. Gilbert, he said Sergeant Gilbert, its been called to my attention that your personnel files shows that you have two years of college, and that you're not exactly an ignorant Texan bird.  I said no, or yes.  He said alright, you're going to go to Personnel.  I thought - Oh Boy - so I did.  I went into Personnel, learned how to type to some extent, working on service records.  And anything anybody else could do they could do a lot better than I could.  But anyway, that's where I was.  Then they sent me to Administrative Inspector's School.  And oh, let's see, by this time I was married.  Let see - how did that happen.   I came down on furlough from Gowan Field.  I had 10 days or 5 days or something  And my girlfriend, who I had been with for a couple or three years now, we were in the hotel bar up on Van Ness Avenue - the Richlou Hotel.  And we'd been drinking, and we were with another couple, who had a car.  The Bagleys.  I said to Noni, "Do you have any money?"  She said, "No.  But I got a check or paycheck for $100.00 - something of that sort.  Can you cash it?"  The bartender said "No," he wouldn't cash it.  But Noni knew somebody who would, and we got the $100.00.  And I said - "Do you want to get married?"  And she said, "Yeah!"  So the Bagley's thought it was a great idea, and they would drive us up to Reno, and they did.  And we got married in Carson City on Oct. 14, 1940.  We came back and she went back to living with her folks, and I was still living on the base in Gallon Field.  I don't know how many months this went on until finally I got a phone call that she was half way to Boise, Idaho on a bus.  She just made up her mind that she wasn't going to live away from her husband any more, period.  That was it.  She was coming up.  And she did.  We found that we had to live in a hotel for a few days until I found a little apartment.  And that began some real happiness - I'm telling you.  My wife got a job with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  Not much of a job, but it was a job.  And I was making pretty fair money as a Master Sergeant out at the base.  I joined the Elks Club purely because it was the only place in town for any enjoyment and any entertainment.  They had slot machines - lots of them in there.  And a bar.  Drinks were cheap.  And I was never an Elk from the standpoint of joining a club or anything - I was simply there to have some fun which I did - we did.  I didn't have a Jeep, I had no transportation then.  So there we were.  We were both making fairly good money and we had nothing to worry about.  I was doing quite a lot of hunting and fishing.  I was in a good position.  I was administrative inspector on the base - assistant administrative inspector to get ammunition and guns and so forth for hunting.  Whereas the civilian population,  and they were all hunters up there, couldn't get any.  So I was asked on these hunts.  Antelope, deer, duck - you name it and we had it.  I had a freezer downtown and it was just filled with wild meat.  They decided that I was a Master Sergeant but that I should be an officer.  I had enough brains, or at least they thought so.  I was too old to go to Officer Training School, so they made me a Warrant Officer.  Which was fine.  It was a promotion in pay and rank.  I could associate with all the officers in the Officer's Clubs, and also with the enlisted men.  I was sort of half-ass in between.  But a Warrant Officer is accorded a pretty good reputation, I guess.  Because in order to be a Warrant Officer, you had to be a specialist in a certain field, and I was a specialist in food.  Also while I was up there in Boise, Idaho, they sent me down to see a William Simplex, who had developed the process of dehydration of food, principally onions and potatoes, because the Boise valley is where the onions and potatoes are grown, and he had his dehydrator up there.  I went down and went through that plant and had many a talk with him, as to how to reconstitute the dehydrated foods and do it properly.  As a matter of fact, I wrote a little bulletin; I don't know if its used now or not, for the Army, on that.  Everything was going fine until they decided that the second Air Force was going to do something in Abilene, Texas.  What it was I'll be damned if I know.  But I was in the administrative end of it then - administrative inspector.  Oh, they were going to start a new type of inspection - in Abilene, Texas.  Well, I never heard of Abilene and they sent me down, along with my wife, of course.  It was a train trip through Idaho, Colorado and then down into Texas, and then finally the bumbling train from Dallas out to this little town of Abilene.  Well, Abilene was a town that Life Magazine wrote up in an entire issue as being the worse town in the United States for the G.I. soldier.  Oh boy - and it was.  It was all the Baptist church.  There wasn't a drink in town - nope.  There wasn't a whore house in town - nope.  But believe me - there was everything else that was supposedly illegal, and was done in a very legal manner.  You could get anything you wanted.  The VD rate was something terrific.  You couldn't get a place to live anywhere off the base, but we did.  Noni went around to these different places.  Wore her shoes out trying to find a place for us to live, and we stayed in the Miller Hotel for I think two weeks before we got a place, which was a converted garage.  It was very cute and comfy and hotter than the-bee jiminy(?) in the summer time.  And Noni had taken a leave of absence from her job.  I was working at the base.  Everything was going along fine, I guess. As an adjunct of the base, the base opened a school for high altitude gunnery pilots before they went overseas, which was down at Matagorda Bay in Texas right on the gulf.  The town was called Palacios.  Well, I was sent down as the only administrative officer.  The Camp Commander was a flying officer and didn't care anything about bookkeeping or any of the rules or regulations.  And I was an assistant administrative inspector, supposedly well able to handle all the payrolls, the books, the this and that and all of the rest of the Army red tape.  So we had school down there.  It would be for about three weeks or maybe it was a month - I don't know.  We had about 20 flying officers, and their training was really rigorous.  We had three tow target planes.  We used to go up and tow these targets and these neophyte fighter pilots would shoot at the target being towed by the tow target.  And go through all the maneuvers.  At the end of the training time, I don't know where they went - overseas, I guess.  Then there was nothing to do for maybe 10 days or maybe a week or two, and the personnel - the instructors were never kept there very long.  So in other words, during the interim when there was nobody down there, there was nobody there except maybe two or three of the tow target officers, and maybe somebody else who was drunk and myself.  Well that was great.  Because one of the men, I've forgotten his name, Captain somebody or other, was just back from Filandia(?) where he made a very fine record and kills for himself and was repatriated home and was one of the gunnery instructors.  He flew the tow target for one of the tow target ships.  He came to me one day and said "Bill, Mr. Gilbert" - or he probably said Bill by that time, because we had gotten drunk together several times over at the old Camp Hulin(?) Club House.  So he said, "Want to take a trip around the country with me?"  I said, "Sure".  Well he lived in Little Rock, Arkansas.  We got into this tow target job, which was an A-17 single engine, the guns had been taken out and there was a place back there where a passenger could ride.  So we took off and went to Little Rock.  Stayed there four - five days while he saw his family.  Then he said "Do you want to go up to Chicago?"  I said "Sure".  So we take off and go over to Chicago.  And of course all the time we would radioing home - back to main base - in Abilene.  We had to ROA we had engine failure or some damn thing so we could stay overnight or a couple of nights.  Finally we ended up - lets see we went back to Denver, and came down to Hamilton Field.  Down in Marin County.  Noni at that time had gone home.  Well I moved down to Palacios down to this camp job and she had gotten on a bus and had a horrible trip, but she got home.  And was working again for the Federal Government.  So when I got to Hamilton Field, why then we had about three or four days, where I could get on a bus, go to San Francisco and stay with my wife.  She was living with her folks and it was beautiful.  Everything was fine and we had a ball.  Then I went on back.  The same Capt. Vance - I think that was his name - I'm not too sure - remembered my duties as a Mess Sergeant back up in Gowan Field.  He had been up there as a Captain, or a Major or Colonel or whatever he was.  And he remembered I knew what to do with food.  He called me on the telephone and he said "Would you care to go overseas?"  And I said "Sure.  You're damn right."  I was getting pretty stale down there in Texas.  He said "Alright - get your stuff packed and ready to go."  And I think it was the next night - or the night after that.  Well, believe me - things started to hum.  I went through hospitals and this and that and so forth so damn fast it would make your head swim.  And they took another plane and flew me up to Colorado Springs in Idaho where I joined what was my final attachment to the Army Air Corps.  I had my teeth fixed and that fixed and the first thing I knew I was on a troop train coming to San Francisco.  I don't know where, or what - yes we did but we didn't.  You know, noise gets around as to where you're going pretty fast.  But anyway, so we got down on the troop train and we came into Oakland.  We were packed on to buses and bussed over to Hamilton Field and stayed two- three days, I guess.  Then packed on to the big C-47's, I guess they were then; ATC - Army Transport Command and flown first to Hawaii and then to Kwajalein I believe it was - no to Johnson - I guess it was, then Kwajalein and then down to Saipan.  Saipan had just been taken.  Wasn't completely taken by a long shot, but nevertheless they considered it taken, where we used the Japanese air field, Eisley Field - it was a big one with the B-29's.  Well the B-29's at that time were the very last word in airplanes.  There were no jets in those days - it was all engines.  We went from Saipan, Guam and Tinian - three islands there in the Marianas and we were to go on these 14 hour flights over the Empire of Japan, bomb Japan and then come back.  Well, that's exactly what happened.  I eventually, not eventually but right away, got into a tent with three other guys, and it was good for a year.  I was in charge of all the mess halls in the headquarters squadron and also inspector General, I guess you could call it that, of all the other mess halls in the 20th bombardment wing - 15th Air Force.  And I had a ball.  I had all the liquor I wanted, because we had formed a pool.  Everybody threw in ten bucks and took a ticket.  But there were many officers there - officers I'm talking about now - officers who did not drink.  So I put in their names, put in my ten bucks.  And when the plane would come back from the mainland - we'd fly the war wearies home, pick up a new plane and come out new, and the new plane was loaded with booze.  And they portioned out the booze according to your tickets and I had like Christmas.  I remember getting 12, 13, 14 bottles because I had all these tickets.  And incidentally I was gambling then on Saipan, and the youth - the pilots - were maybe 20, 19, 20, 21, they didn't know if they were going to come back - and a lot of them didn't.  So they gambled with their money and were pretty free with it.  I was making quite a little money - quite a lot.  So I had plenty of booze.  That was when I had the idea of buying Noni a wrist watch.  I wrote Granite Brothers in San Francisco and told them to send me - which they did - pictures and descriptions and what they could do for as much as $800 - $900 for a wrist watch - for them to make up with the diamonds and rubies, and so on.  And in those days jewels, I mean, things weren't as expensive as they are now.  So eventually they did - I never saw the watch.  I arranged with Marie, who is Wenonah's (my wife's) sister, and also with the hotel for a luncheon for Noni.  I don't know if it was a birthday luncheon, I don't remember.  But anyway her closest friends were there and it was a real bang-up luncheon.  I spent everything - I bought everything I could.  (Tape space.  End of second tape)  She got a watch and everything was happy and fine and dandy. Well, the end of the war came along and because I had enough points for being overseas, I was one of the first to be flown home. And I got back to McClellan Field in San Francisco, which was after about a year on Saipan.  The war was over - it was 1945.  I got out of the service in McClellan Field in Sacramento.  I called Noni, my wife, and she came on up.  The strike was on and she came up on the bus and had a hell of a time getting there.  Came into the hotel.  All the time I had been overseas I had all my money sent to her with the exception of $25 a month.  Something of that sort.  She didn't know and, well she thought I was probably broke.  I had been drinking pretty heavy at the hotel, naturally, and telling great big lies about everything that had happened, was going to happen and would happen during the war, with the rest of my soldier boys.  When I first came from McClellan Field I came down to the main hotel in Sacramento, the Senator I think it was - and no room.  So, $25.00 got me a room alright.  Not only got me a room, but got me the bridal suite or something.  And I had champagne up there and I had all this money - I don't know - it was $2,000 - $3,000 - or maybe it was $200 - $300.  I don't know.  But it was a lot of money.  It smelled of the sweat and the stink and the mildew from Saipan.  And I remember the last night coming home - we had flown from Saipan to Kwajalein - the first stopover.  The next morning we had an engine go out on takeoff and it was really scary.  Maintenance wasn't too good on them.  But we were able to get around, come back and lay over and we had to stay there for three days and those three days I wasn't sober a minute.  Of course.  But also there was a crap game going on, several of them.  Well I got into the crap game and I made nothing but heavy - no I won't say heavy, but anyway, good loot, and I don't know, but anyway I made a couple of thousand or more.  So when Noni came into the room at the hotel in Sacramento I had all this money thrown all over the room - all over the bed, the floor, the blankets the whole damn thing and the champagne sitting there and I was king of the world.  The great egotist - I was it.  Well, she went along and everything was fine.  And oh boy, we were happy.  So we came back to San Francisco after I got out of the service and got out of uniform, and my father-in-law, who had some strings to pull, was able to get me an old Model A - Ford - I guess it was a Coupe - I don't remember.  So we took off in this car and went back up the coast to Crater Lake, Oregon, went across the Oregon deserts, and Idaho deserts, and back to Boise, Idaho, where we met some of our friends.  And the car broke down.  We stayed in the Miller Hotel, I remember then.  Anyway the car got fixed, and then we came back and stopped in Winnemucca - well that was my downfall.  We spent quite a bit of money on the trip doing everything we wanted to.  Well Winnemucca is a gambling town just like Reno.  The main being in the hotel main gambling room.  I was drunker than a goat.  Noni had gone upstairs and had gone to bed.  And I was going to make a million bucks.  Well, I didn't - I lost a million bucks.  I finally had to wire home to a bar owner in San Francisco whom we had known to send us enough money to get home on.  So we got home.  Now I was out of the service.  We were in San Francisco and Noni had a job - a good job in those days.  She was working hard.  We took an apartment - it was on Geary I guess it was, I don't know.  And I was nervous in the service.  I was drinking, and I didn't know where the hell I wanted to go.  I picked up a real estate license and tried to do some real estate business out of my hat - and didn't do very well.  I didn't do well at all.  So then I started taking these tests.  No.  I got a job with the Yellow Cab Company through a good friend of Noni's - a Mr. & Mrs. Petit.  It was THE Yellow Cab Company at the time.  And I got a job driving one of these hokey cop Chevrolet Coupes going around and checking up on the taxi drivers and telling them where to go and what not to do and hauling drunks out of bars and one thing or another.  And I didn't like that because you had to be married to the Yellow Cab Company, to get anywhere.  I was working all the time, and hard work - good job for the man who wanted it - excellent - but not for me.  So I began taking all these examinations and tests for Federal Government jobs, State jobs - any kind and finally I had taken one job for an overseas job as an administrative officer.  I didn't know where, but I got the call - come on down.  Incidentally, I was drawing $20 every Thursday, a Veterans benefit at that time.  So I got a call to come down, and I got a job as a CAF 8 - 7, 8, 9, something of that sort - over in the Philippines.  The contract would be for three years.  To cut the story short - I did.  Left my wife - got on the boat and got over to Manila.  Well the reason for my being there was that they had established these tremendous dumps - I called them dumps - deposits of materials for the foot invasion of Japan.  The war was over and here was all this material - anything you could name - from bulldozers to sulfa pills.  Millions of dollars worth of stuff - dumped - tarps over some of it - some of it not.  To be catalogued and shipped either to Z.I. zone of Interior(?) back to the United States, or to different possessions we had, namely Okinawa , Kobe and so on.  Well I was in charge of the shipping section.  Well the U.S. Government having had a great surplus of G.I. trucks gave them all - sold them supposedly, but they didn't, but gave them to the Philippine government.  The Philippine Government, then comprised of some very entrepreneurial like individuals - Filipinos or Chinese I guess most of them were - so they got all the trucks.  Then the Federal Government contracted with these same people to use these same trucks and paid them money to come and get this material we'd ship out to these different ports.  They would ship them out in convoys because they were continually being harassed and robbed and stolen.  Fourteen, fifteen, maybe sixteen trucks at a time of clothes, food, ammunition - you name it, we had it.  So a convoy would start to go out - would be lined up somewhere, and I would get a little note on my desk and the code name was changed every hour.  So they could get out the main gates.  All I had to do was mention the code name to somebody and then they could go out and be on there way to different barrios or somewhere - not to their point of destination.  They had Filipino scouts in on the thing and didn't help any.  One morning I came down and there was $2,000 sitting on my desk.  It was in pesos, 4,000 pesos.  That's all there was.  I knew what I had to do.  I don't know if the load was sugar or materials or what the hell it was.  I thought and thought and I thought now Boy,  there is enough for me to make my stake - will I or won't I?  Well, I don't think that my good thoughts won out, I think it was the thought of being caught doing it that made me say no.  I left the money in the desk.  I didn't give out the code words and the convoy sat and I went out and got drunk.  I came back the afternoon - the next day - the money was gone - the convoy was gone properly the way it should have been - supposedly to its point of destination.  And I guess it got there - I don't know.  But anyway I didn't take the money.  That was the only good thing I think I ever did.  My wife was not with me for the first year.  I lived in the barracks.  We had a very nice club house and everything was hunkey dorey - lots of booze.  I never passed out or got drunk as drunk could be.  No I was just drinking all the time.  Well, finally she was able to come out.  The Government said, "Yeah, you've been there a year now, you can have your dependent come on out and Noni came out by boat.  When she got off the boat I went out to meet her.  When she got off on the dock, I had a jeep there with a driver.  By the time I knew she was coming, I had arranged for quarters at the Philippine University.  Afterwards she said it was very nice, but at first she thought it was a horrible house.  I had it furnished with everything from the depot that you could think of.  I had the stereo phonograph - I had a piano - I had the walls decorated by an artist - a Filipino artist painted this and that, and the floors were all waxed and polished and everything was spit and polished.  The rest of the civilians didn't have that opportunity to get these things that I did, and they were pretty jealous.  Because a lot of the civilians around there were a lot higher ranking than I was, but anyway I had them.  Certainly I could go to the commissary warehouses and get the candy and so on.  Now, Noni didn't have anything to do because we had house servants - Lavender, the cook, the chauffeur.  The chauffeur was with me all the time - he was my boy.  So she started at the Officers Club playing bridge, I guess.  So she amused herself with that.  I was supposedly working, but what the hell - you didn't work at all.  You worked approximately three hours a day - maybe - then go down to the Elks Club, the Army and Navy Club and drink.  Well that job ran out and the only other one I could have to complete my three years was with the AGRS - The Army Graves Registration Service - which was rather interesting.  These search and rescue missions were going out to the different island where they had heard that crashes were or some sort of a fracas, and they would dig up the remains of the American soldiers, bring them back.  We had three big hangars at Nichols Field - three of the big airplane hangars there with all of the tables laid out and all of the bones put together and laid out and for us to identify them.  So that they could be sent home for proper burial.  Well of course it was a great big rip-off on the part of the undertakers in the United States - funeral directors and so on.  It was very interesting to do.  I don't know how many thousands and thousands of remains we sent home.  One day, Noni said, "Gee we should have some plants around our house."  I said "Yeah!"  I heard about a place called Wa Wa dam.  It was a sugar mill that the Japs had wrecked, ruined, but it was at this dam up there where the virga(?) was terrific and these different plants - orchids and so forth were growing.  So I said, "O.K. Honey, we'll go up tomorrow, or the next day."  So I got a little trailer hitched on the back of my jeep, and took two boys with me - my regular boy and another one, and of course Noni.  We went on up and had a fine time.  And loaded the trailer down with plants of all kinds.  Gee, it was a trailer load.  Coming on back - it was about 20 - 30 Km northwest of Manila, we were held up.  About 10 or 12 Filipinos put the guns on us.  They got us.  It wasn't very nice.  I was scared to death and so was everybody else.  But I was probably more scared than any of them.  They took the jeep, took my guns, and marched the four of us over through the sword grass underneath a big banyan tree about a half mile away from this road - just a little country road.  They sat us down there and said they were going to kill us.  O.K.  So Noni and I said good-bye to each other.  And they posted a sentry on the hill with another guy up there; both with guns on us.  But the sword grass was so high that if we ducked down they couldn't see us.  We had been there I don't know how many hours.  They had taken our jewelry and everything else - wristwatches and rings, and so on.  I spoke a little Tagalog and tried to get them to let me go and told them I would be ransom.  No.  I guess it was about 4 - 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and I could look around and didn't know if the sentry was there or not or if he was sleeping.  So I motioned to the Filipino guys I had with me and I said - Come on.  So we left the banyan tree, went through the sword grass and got back to the road.  Well, just as we got back there, luckily enough, a jeep came along piloted by white boys who recognized we were white and that we were stranded.  So they picked us up and took us back to the next Filipino station where we went to a Filipino guard house, told them my story.  They paid no attention and didn't give a damn.  The usual thing.  (Tape space. End of first side, third tape.)  She said: "Honey, I can't take it any more - I got to go home - now."  She had been out there about a year I guess.  My contract was up - or just about.  So I talked to the General in charge of Army Grave Registration Service - told him the story and he said, "O.K. - Bill, you're going home."  It was about a week later, less than that, I guess, we were on a boat on the old General Pope, on the way back to San Francisco.  We got back home and then I don't know - lets see what the hell happened next.  Yeah - I took another examination for a job with the Employment Service of California - State of California as an investigator.  I got the job.  They put me to work and that was a wonderful job.  I had to check in the office in the morning, but I didn't have to check in at night.  I used my car.  I was working with - or against I guess - employers who had deducted the money from employees pay checks and failed to turn it in, or failed to file the reports at all.  And I had to go out and try to find assets on which to levy, and maybe put them into bankruptcy.  To collect this money or get the reports or both.  Then I left the office at maybe 9 or 10 in the morning, got in the car and I had a whole bunch of folders.  I did, for a couple of months, work pretty good.  I did a good job and was commended on it.  But then I thought - aw shoot - this is not copacetic.  So there was a bar in North Beach called Ray's that Noni and I used to frequent.  Those were the days when North Beach was North Beach - not the junk that it is now.  So I would go over there.  They opened about 10:30 or 11:00 - fine.  So I'd go there and started drinking.  Maybe work behind the bar a little bit, while Ray, the owner, went away or something.  And I had all the drinks I wanted.  I would stay there - shit, shucks I mean - I would stay there all day.  I was getting gas mileage on the car and I had to keep a very meticulous account of where I went, how I went, mileage and times.  Well I fouled up, and they pulled me in and started checking on my mileage.  Well it didn't add up at all.  Well to make a long story short, I don't know how long I worked there - a year - two years I guess - until they said, "Well, Mr. Gilbert, you're through."  So I resigned while under investigation.  That was that.  I lost that job.  In the mean time I had borrowed from different lending organizations, and I never paid them back.  They were coming down on Noni and this fine job she had.  She would go absolutely nuts.  Why she didn't leave me I don't know.  To this day - I don't know.  I got her in more jams than you can think of.  We moved a couple of times and we had fun - yeah - we had.  But not fun - fun.  It was different.  Noni was worried of course - all the time.  So here I was again without a job.  Through my good friend Col. White, who was head of Federal Narcotics Bureau, I got a license as a private investigator.  Once again, that was duck soup.  I got to work writing out subpoenas, and serving papers and doing investigative work for different attorneys in San Francisco - some of the biggest ones - making some money, but damn little.  I was drinking most of the time - drinking it up.  By that time, Eric and Irene O'Brien, Noni's mother and father, said "Look you two - you've got to buy a house."  So to make a long story short, they advanced us $3,000.  Gave us $3,000.  $2,000 for the house and $1,000 for the move from San Francisco over to where we are living now - in Strawberry.  Paid $14,000 or $14,500 something of that sort for the house, which today we could sell for $150,000 - $130,000.  So we had a place to live - on a Cal Vet loan - very low payments.  Well the first thing I did was to break a leg - break my knee - put me in a cast for awhile - all this while I was working - supposedly was working as an investigator.  Noni was carrying the burden of proof.  The Veterans Administration of course paid for the monthly payments on the house while I was incapacitated - I had a mortgage insurance on the house.  And so I said - Hell, this isn't making any money - so I think I'll go back in the real estate business.  So I took out my license and started advertising other real estate broker's listings - caught hell for that.  I made a couple of sales - I don't know.  But George Brockman of Brockman Real Estate, who was just starting in business saw my ads.  And said - Who is this guy anyhow!  He called me up and told me to come on down.  I went on down and that began a happy - I guess it was a happy - 10 years or so with him.  We built a new building and I was the General Manager - I was getting $500 a month for managing the joint.  I was making around $15,000 - $20,000 a year, which in those days was quite good.  Drinking all the time.  George threatened to fire me two or three times because I was drunk, but anyway - I don't know what happened.  Oh yes - George died.  He had cancer of the liver or something.  And when he died, a lot of me died with him because he was just the same as a son to me.  He was younger and a go-getter.  The place was taken over by a guy by the name of Allen - who I brought into the Real Estate business and who was a really fast, sharp operator.  I couldn't stand working with him.  In the first place, he wouldn't stand for the drinking.  (Telephone rings in background)  So I retired from the Real Estate business.  I didn't have any intention of retiring, but anyway they gave me a party, and something or other.  I didn't do anything for about a week or two, except drink.  Finally joined a very small one or two man office in Mill Valley, named Craymar's.  I sold some things down there - made a little money.  One way or the other.  Then it got too sterile for me.  There wasn't enough action at all.  Oh it was a deadly thing.  And I was drinking all the time.  So I left there and went down with Don and Lis Fraser, who had opened a Real Estate business in Mill Valley.  And in my more sober moments I made a few sales, made a few bucks.  But I was drinking - drinking - drinking.  I remember one time I came into the office in the morning, and Don Fraser said - "Bill, you've got to show Mrs. Jones - or whatever her name was - that house this afternoon."  I said "What house?"  Well this house - and he described it to me - and I said, "And who is Mrs. Jones?"  He detailed to me my conversation on the phone with her, and I had no recollection whatsoever of talking to Mrs. Jones, of seeing the house that I had described to her - or anything.  It was a complete black-out.  This wasn't the first one, but it was the main one.  And I thought, Whoa Bill!  Wait a minute!  So a day or two later, I went up and had a talk with George Kagelman - Kagelman, Seymour & Hamilton - the firm I'm with now.  Told them that I drank - they said "Well, as long as you don't drink in the office and don't come in drunk, its O.K. with us."  It's an old line firm, such as the Wall Street Journal is in New York.  Most of the people in there are quite well to do and a very, very fine office.  I was given a big desk and subsequently upstairs with a fire place in the room - there were four desks there.  Downstairs was the main part.  And they sent me with the proofs to go on down to a printer in Mill Valley to have my cards printed and an announcement of my joining the firm.  So I went on down, walked in and met this guy Charlie. Charlie knew that I was a drunk and Charlie himself was a reconstituted drunk.  Not recovered, but he wasn't drinking.  He had hit a very low spot - everything was gone - he lost his wife, he lost his job, he lost everything - he was out, until somebody brought him to AA - Alcoholics Anonymous.  And he had been in Alcoholics Anonymous then about three years.  And he recognized in me a fellow traveler - so far as being drunk was concerned.  Some woman had actually come into his shop and said, "Look Charlie, you're on AA.  Why don't you get that guy in the Real Estate office right across the street over there.  He's drunk all the time and bring him in there."  Charlie said, "I can't do that.  He has to come to us."  Make a long story short - Charlie talked to me about AA.  Well, I thought, by golly, maybe this was a chance.  Now remember, this was the first time - it was my birthday - November 4th or 5th I have forgotten what year it was - four years ago, I guess.  It was my first day at work on the new job and I was introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous.  Well, I went to a meeting, and I was just open enough to say, Yeah - this just might do it.  I recognized my life was completely unmanageable.  I was going to walk out and leave Noni - you know everything the drunken insanity does.  I started going to meetings and then I started making coffee at the meetings and setting up the chairs. And so forth.  Then I finally got to be secretary at one of the meetings.  This was naturally after a year or two, and I was imbued with AA - completely.  Thought I was.  Alcoholics Anonymous is not only a non-drinking deal, but it's a program to live.  It's a program for a new life.  Wonders never cease.  Now its been about four years, and I had one bad slip.  First the doctor told me I had to go into the hospital for a prostate operation - O.K. I did.  That was just last year - 1979.  Came out of the hospital and was home a week or two, and it was Christmas Eve 1979.  It was 2 o'clock in the morning.  We had been to my mother-in-laws for Christmas dinner.  I hadn't been drinking - I was cold sober.  About 1 o'clock in the morning I got up and I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water.  I didn't turn the lights on.  I didn't see my dog, whom I love dearly, in the middle of the living room, and I fell down and knew when I hit the floor that I had broken a hip.  So I yelled screaming, bloody murder.  Noni got the ambulance and they hauled me up to Marin General.  And the next day - or the day after that - they operated on me and put in the usual plates and pins and screws and bolts and whatever the hell they do.  I'm just recovering from that now.  A week ago I had a lot of trouble going to the bathroom - urinating.  The pain was excruciating.  So I went back to the same doctor who had done the prostate operation.  So he said come back....  (Tape space.)  Must have found that there was gravel, or rocks, pea gravel or whatever you want to call it - in the duct between the bladder and the prostate and he couldn't get them out.  He showed me one of them.  My God - it was the size of a pea.  Well I couldn't take that.  It was with a local anesthetic where they poured some juice down the side of the urethra.  And he said you'll have to go to the hospital.  So that's where it stands now.  On the 23rd - Wednesday the 23rd, I go to the hospital for the next operation, and I guess it will be alright.  Things are a little rough physically, but I am not drinking.  AA meant a new life for me.  Bye.  (First End)  Well this is January 6, 1981.  Many things have happened since the last tape.  I am now drinking again, and I wish I could stop.  I'm trying to and I can go four, five, six, seven, eight days and then bingo - I blow it.  But I think I can still get it licked - and I'm trying.  The operation on the bladder was successful, and they pulled out the stones, and I feel better as a result of that.  However, the back, the hips, the knees and all the rest of it, due to arthritis, puts me in a pretty bad shape and a pretty hurtful one.   I do take codeine once or twice a day, but the trouble is when I take one towards evening time, and I've had a drink or two - oh brother - Vesuvius really blows.  My own business, this last year, has been absolutely nil.  I've had none - no income whatsoever, except of course social security and Noni's good size pension.  I really do not know what will happen next.  If I can stop this drinking, which is only four or five drinks a day, but that's just four or five too many.  (Tape space.  End of Tape 3)  Well, I'm 73 now, or will be in a month or two, and things are kind of slowing down a little bit.  I hurt and can't get over it, but that doesn't deter me from still trying.  The arthritis has set into the back, and the big chunk of metal in my hip and leg is not too good.  And I've just gotten over one helluva cold.  I guess they called it pneumonia.  I didn't know if I was going to make it or not - but I did - so I'm still around.  Noni is out playing bridge again tonight.  She hits it about three or four nights a week, which thank God is very good for her, and she is very enamored of the entire thing.  Maybe she will write a book some day - I don't know.  She is recovering from a very bad accident - wasn't bad as far as physical things are concerned, except that she did bust a couple of ribs and the inside of her mouth was sewed up and one thing or another.  And she has had a hell of a time - it was very traumatic.  And we're being sued by the car she ran into.  There are a lot of troubles.  The car got fixed up at one place, then they found the steering gear and everything else was haywire, so its now in another place.  Insurance companies are taking care of most of it however.  So, it isn't too much of a problem to me.  Except that Noni doesn't have her car.  She does have to appear in court on May 5th with a pretty bad - I won't go into it - deal for her.  We have a pretty good attorney, and I have high hopes some of the charges being reduced to something lower.  If not, the insurance premiums will jump about four times, either that or be completely discontinued.  And with our insurance policies canceled out and then I'll have to go to the high risk stuff, which is, well, damned near impossible, but it will have to be done.  So far as business is concerned, I get down to the office maybe two or three hours a day and maybe not even a day as far as that goes.  I have a very lovely office - a fireplace in it, oak ceilings, and carpets on the floor and all that sort of stuff, and I enjoy being there.  Its very good.  I have only one listing now for sale, which is a bar in Larkspur for a half a million bucks, and it looks pretty good.  If I can sell it myself to the buyer, in other words represent both the buyer and the seller, I've got a $50,000 commission.  If it has to be split, fine - its only $25,000 and it goes down, but that's O.K. too.  The drinking so far as I'm concerned, is still a problem.  Probably will be till I'm pushing the daisies.  But I've been able to control it to a good extent.  I don't know if Noni is still thinking of taking off for a big run or not, and I won't know until after this accident trial and one thing and another is over with.  I'm doing all that I can in connection with all of that to relieve her of any of the - well not the liability - but responsibility concerning that same trial.  Which she does appreciate a great deal.  Anyway, Ethel, my life is sort of coming to a close.  I guess it might be 15 years or it might be next month, but that doesn't bother me too much.  Doesn't bother me at all, as a matter of fact.  The stuff that I put on the tapes to you is pretty boring, I imagine, but anyway you got them.  And I think frankly, Ethel, you are the only one with whom I have been completely honest with my backgrounds, and whys, whats, and wheres and whens.  You can do with them as you wish, but kind of tone it down a little bit.  I don't know, I'm putting myself in a position where I think I have done more than I have - which I have not.  Anyway this is sort of a swan song - the end of the entire business, and I hope you have some fun listening to it anyway.  You might get a few laughs.  Anyway - But there goes that "anyway" again.  I use that too much.  I don't know if I said it before, but its now March 15 or 16, or April  15 - I'm a little behind here - and I don't know if I'll ever have a chance of seeing you again, but I still want to thank you for the tremendous work you have done insofar as the family is concerned.  By the way did you know there was a funny story running around - well not running around, but my Dad used to tell it to me.  Way in our background, the name Gilbert is fairly prominent - supposedly the Gilbert name comes down from the bastard half brother to Sir Walter Raleigh.  The name was Sir Humphrey Gilbert.  Did I say a half brother - bastard - I don't know.  It's a good big fairy story, I guess, but it's a lot of fun to think about.  Anyhow - well Good night to you Ethel.  God bless you, and all of your family.  I do want to leave this last remark that Enid was one of my very great favorites.  She was not only charming - she was extremely intelligent and knew a lot of things that she didn't talk about and certainly wouldn't talk about to me.  But anyway, I loved her.  And good bye to you all - right.  Bye.  (Tape gap - Beginning of second ending)  ...the hospital.  And her lips sutured, bleeding to beat hell, and of course the terrific traumatic thoughts in her mind made her fight like heck.  Not with her fists, but with her mouth.  She was taken up by two great big burly California Highway Patrol cops, hand cuffed and thrown into the back of the car and taken up to the drunk tank, where she stayed until 4:30 the next morning.  Of course I was there when she came on out, brought her home.  She was a pretty sorry gal.  It was the first time anything ever happened to her at all.  Actually it wasn't the alcohol in her blood, although that showed up.  It was the traumatic thoughts of the fight and the this and that and everything that had happened to her before she ever took off.  We're still going through a traumatic thing on getting her car fixed and the other car fixed and suits on this and this and that and everything, and God I don't know when its going to stop.  I don't know.  But she realized that I did take care of the entire thing.  Who, what, why, where - you know what I mean.  The things with the suits, the law suits and the this and the that - and the insurance company scraps and everything, and I think the divorce thing is pretty well empty from her mind for the present time.  It may come back later, I don't know.  But, anyway, I'm not feeling too well about the whole thing.  And now to get back to my problem - and that is alcohol.  I have been drinking fairly heavily, I guess - never really drunk - oh, since I was 16 or 17 during the bootlegging days.  And now I did join, several years ago, (I may have told you on one of my other tapes) Alcoholics Anonymous, which is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful organization - although it is not an organization, it is just simply a group.  Here in Marin County, there are I would say about 20 different little groups that meet once a week.  And they retell their troubles and their this and their that - but they are not sad.  They are happy, they are fun, all the rest of it.  They have been able to conquer alcoholism, which is a God-awful drug.  I can't go into it - how much it really is.  For about three years, I was very active in it, and then, I don't know.  The euphoria wore off.  The smugness sort of disintegrated, and I just could not take some of the stories that were being told at the different meetings.  I knew they were true.  I knew that the people who were telling these things were telling the truth, but I couldn't take it for myself.  I started drinking again.  You know, wine, beer, no not beer, but wine, vodka, and so on.  So now, at the present time, 12 o'clock shows up and I take off from the office and I go to a bar - the one I have for sale incidentally, and I have three, four, maybe five drinks.  And I come on home and usually go to the market and do the marketing.  I do most of that.  And I either lay down and go to sleep for a couple of hours, or sit on the patio or do some damn thing.  Then I come out to the kitchen and start dinner and this and that, and start drinking.  Where I will have maybe three drinks, maybe four, that's all.  I am not sober by any manner or means - I know that.  But I'm not drunk.  I'm an alcoholic, and I just can not kick the entire thing, Helen.  It's a rough one.  I don't know how to tell you, because I know you don't drink.  But it is a disease - well, I can't go into it.  If you want to, buy or get and read a book of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Its wonderful.  Its beautiful.  But you've got to be in a mood to take it.  (The final end).</li>
