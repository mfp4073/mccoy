<li id="c5239.4">[<a href="s13.htm#s620">S620</a>] Article about Edward Arthur Owens.  <i>Des Moines Tribune</i>, All Carlisle Reveres Patriarch Owens, 90.  By Herb Owens.  (The Tribune Staff Writer.)  CARLISLE, IA.-- It would be a distinct pleasure and honor to claim kinship with Edward Arthur Owens, congenial, kindly patriarch of the great Owens clan here--but I dare not.  Owens, alert and active at 90, is the type of man who's revered by almost "everyone in town," a man to whom all kin can "point with pride."  He's known to all as Arthur.  Hundreds of letters, cards and greetings poured in on Owens on election day, his ninetieth birthday, while he was working from early morning until late at night as an election judge.  Born on an Ohio farm, Owens came to Warren county in 1871 when the foundations of the Iowa statehouse were being laid in a sticky mass of clay.  For the last 67 years, he's lived in the same house north of the business district here.  For years, just as he still does, Owens drove out to his farm several miles east of town on the Des Moines river bottom--the 236 acre place now operated by Frederick Owens, one of three sons.  "Last year, 1947, was the only year in all these years that we did not raise a crop of any kind--not a thing.  We've been flooded many times, but never like last year," he said, sitting in the home of another son, Guy Owens, who operates the sawmill here.  The old gentleman, with a brother, the late Robert Walter Owens operated a sawmill here for 20 years or more--back in the days when timberlands in the hills around Carlisle were filled with elm, cottonwood, hickory, walnut, oak, hackberry and maple, and the haul to the mill was short.  Former Mayor.  Owens, a former mayor of Carlisle, served 28 years on the Carlisle school board and 12 years on the Warren county board of education.  He was active in the Warren County Farm bureau, the Carlisle Baptist church, and for years has been a member of the Masonic orders--Carlisle lodge, Za Ga Zig Shrine, and thirty-second degree Masons.  He's also a member of the Modern Woodmen of America.  Owens loves life--and especially life in Carlisle, a town of 690 in Warren county about 12 miles southeast of Des Moines.  Last year he went sightseeing on the east coast, visiting his eldest son, George Owens, who is secretary of the New York Underwriters Insurance Co., and studied the life and habits of folks in crowded cities.  "My son George lives in Westfield, N. J., and takes a train into New York every day to work," Owens said.  "I wouldn't like that.  I wouldn't want to live in the city, either.  I don't think people enjoy life there.  It's so crowded and there's such a constant rush."  "I did have my first airplane ride last year on that trip--flew over the coast near Philadelphia where my grandfather and father landed in 1834, coming from Wales.  I visited the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty, took a boat ride around Manhattan, visited Alexander Hamilton's grave, and spent "Franklin day" in Philadelphia.  Rather Live Here.  "I had fun, I enjoyed it all--but I'd rather live out here," he said.  Besides his three sons, Owens has a daughter, Mrs. Mabel Shaffer of Des Moines.  A younger brother, Henry L. Owens, who has four sons, lives in Carlisle.  Owens has four granddaughters, all grown to young womanhood, and one great-granddaughter.  It was just last April, however, that the first grandson was born, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Owens.  Being the only grandchild to carry on the Owens name, the youngster has been named "Arthur," honoring the patriarch.  No pride could be greater than that of the old Arthur for the new one; that is, unless you consider the pride of all the grandchildren for their grandfather.<a href="e682.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c5239.5">[<a href="s13.htm#s180">S180</a>] Obituary for Edward Arthur Owens.  Edward Arthur Owens, eldest son of Hugh and Eliza Elliott Owens, was born in a log cabin, near Jackson, Ohio, November 2, 1858.  In 1871 the family came to this community to another log cabin home, east of Carlisle.  The pioneer father died shortly thereafter, leaving the mother, three sons and three daughters.  Responsibilities of large proportions fell on all of the older children at an early age.  It took the combined strength of the two small boys, Arthur and Walter, to manage the one-horse plow with which they prepared their soil for planting.  In later years these brothers continued their partnership in many years of sawmill business and farming operations until Walter's death.  In 1881, Arthur purchased the place that has been his home for 75 years.  His mother resided with him until her death.  He married Miss Bushie Long, of Indianola, December 20, 1893.  Their four children are: Mrs. Mabel Shaffer, George, Guy and Frederic, all present at the services.  There are six grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.  Arthur was a devoted son, companion and father, also a loyal friend and stalwart citizen, accepting many responsibilities in this community.  He was superintendent of the Carlisle Baptist Sunday School, for twenty years, having united with this church as a young man.  He served forty years on the school board of town and county, and on the town council for many years.  He was a fifty-year Mason and a member of the local lodge, also a member of the Consistory and a Shriner.  He maintained an intense interest in current events, and was equally interested in the past.  A life-long habit and love of good reading gave him an unusual knowledge of history, especially that of our country.  In the storehouse of fine memory he cherished passages of scripture and many poems which he recited eloquently.  He was preceded in death by his wife, in the fiftieth year of their marriage; by his brothers, Walter and Henry, the latter by only a few weeks; and by his sisters, Mrs. Mary Sanders, Mrs. Harrah Lynch and Mrs. Ellen Patterson.  He has toiled through the heat of many a harvest and how reaps the final harvest of the years, going peacefully to his eternal home on April 3, 1956, at the age of ninety-seven and five months.  "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."<a href="e671.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Obituary for Edward Arthur Owens"></a></li>
<li id="c5239.6">[<a href="s2.htm#s565">S565</a>] Source not known, GRANDFATHER: PIONEER.  Written by Mabel Owens Shaffer.  The door of the little log cabin stood wide open to admit the bright October sunshine.  Up the steep hill leading to the crude shelter, the bent figure of an old man toiled laboriously.   As he approached the cabin two little girls appeared at the window and shouted to their mother that the long awaited package had arrived.  The man was invited into the cabin and he immediately deposited his burden upon the table whereupon the mother and the two little girls proceeded to open it with the children looking on in breathless anticipation.  As the wrappings fell away disclosing a wonderful Seth Thomas clock, they hid their awed faces in the folds of their mother's skirts.  The old man laughed at them and walked over to a small wooden crib in the corner.  He glanced down at the tiny baby boy kicking and cooing contentedly to himself within.  "That's a fine boy you've got there, Miz Owens," he remarked.  Thus began a lifelong association between the Seth Thomas clock and Edward Arthur Owens, a grand old clock and a grand old man.<br> One of Arthur's earliest recollections was Morgan's raid in Ohio.  It was rumored throughout the country that Morgon and his men were coming.  Arthur's father and some other men had gone to lay trees across the roads and bridges to obstruct their passage.  Arthur's mother was going to milk the cows.  A neighbor rode up to the fence and shouted something to her.  In her fright she thought that he had said that Morgon was coming.  In reality he had said that his wife was sick and wanted her.  She wildly threw her milk pail away and rushed back to the cabin to get her four little children and flee with them into the woods.  She also rounded up a bay mare of which she was very proud as she had heard that Morgon took all the horses that he could find.  Baby Arthur, who was then three years old, resolutely refused to go till he got his pants buttoned and had to be dragged off by sheer force.  So with the mother carrying baby Ellen under one arm and leading the baby mare with the other and the two older girls dragging Arthur between them and all of them whimpering this strange procession moved into the woods and found refuge in a ravine where they remained until they heard their father calling them.  Morgon and his men went just two miles south of them after all.<br> Arthur's mother, Eliza Elliot, was a wonderful woman, very attractive and intelligent and a firm believer in cleanliness.  She gave birth to six children, Mary, Hannah, Arthur, Ellen, Walter, and Henry.<br> Sometimes Hannah and Mary took little Arthur out for long walks.  His father had given him a toy gun and Arthur liked to shoot snow at the tiny gray lizards that scooted over and under the rail fences.  Once, when his two older sisters were playing with their dolls in the old lean-to shed, he slipped up to a crack in the wall and squirted slop all over the little girls and their dolls.  Arthur still has that toy gun.<br> He went to school in a frame school with benches for seats.  On the last day of school it was the custom for the teachers to give all the children a small card with the words "Reward of Merit" printed on it.  Arthur still has this card also.<br> Arthur's mother has always used tallow candles which she made herself but one day their father brought a kerosene lamp home.  The children had heard that his lamp was a wonderful thing.  It shed much more light than many candles, and they were full of awe.  When their father first lighted the lamp, shy little Ellen promptly disappeared under the table.  She remembers it yet and says that she thought that the blaze would be as long as her arm.<br> Arthur's happiest memories are those of the excursions in the woods, rocky regions, gulfs, and canyons that the family took on foot every now and then.  This part of Ohio was rough with coal and iron mines.  On these excursions, they would gather in their winter's supply of wintergreen, chestnuts, persimmons,huckleberries, dewberries, and blackberries, all kinds of apples, peaches and other fruits.<br> Arthur also remembers clearly the flights of the passenger pigeons.  They would fly in flocks so large as to darken the sky overhead.  Sometimes they would settle on the branch of a tree and the branch would crack and crash to the ground under the strain of their immense weight.  Arthur's father would often take a pole and knock some of the pigeons from a branch and take them home to his wife, Eliza.  She would fry them down in butter and they would keep for many weeks.<br> The passenger pigeons were destroyed so recklessly that now in Ohio there are none left.  The deer were also ruthlessly destroyed and Arthur still remembers the last deer killed in the county.<br> The Owens family left Ohio on the 15th of March, 1870, and came to Illinois.  There is one outstanding incident distinct still in Arthur's memory at the time of this move.  At Lafayette, Indiana, the family had to change trains.  It was very, very cold and the snow was falling.  A man came blustering into the station and said there was a dead baby in the outbuilding, so another man took a wheelbarrow out to get it but it was frozen stiff and he came back holding it in his arms.  This made a great impression on the children.<br> The family lived one year in Illinois and then moved on to Iowa.  There they lived ten years on their father's brother's farm.  In 1874 Arthur's father died, leaving young Arthur the man of the family.  He was not very strong, having the ague disease, which was prevalent in those days.  He rented and cared for a piece of land from his Uncle John.  He was too young and not strong enough to hold both the lines and plow handle, so his brother, Walter helped him.  Thus began the partnership of these brothers which was broken only by the death of Walter in 1929.<br> It was a hard struggle for Arthur to support his three sisters, two younger brothers, his mother, and himself.  He worked very hard.  He cut and hauled wood to Des Moines, he helped the neighboring farmers thresh, and did anything he could turn his hand to.<br> While Arthur was still living on his uncle's farm, some Indians came and camped in the timber nearby.  The family was afraid of them but they did nothing except beg for food.<br> One year in September, the river overflowed and came seeping through the doors of the little cabin covering the floors with murky waters.  Finally the family had to abandon their little dwelling, and their uncle rescued them with boats.<br> In 1880, all three of Arthur's sisters were married and the next year Arthur, his mother, and his brothers moved to Carlisle, Iowa.  Now in 1938, he still lives on the same lot in the little town although a new house was built in 1893.<br> GRANDFATHER: HIS LATER LIFE.<br> Soon after Arthur built the new house, he met and married Bushie Long of Indianola, Iowa.  She was an attractive, intelligent young woman.  She had red hair, lovely brown eyes, and a pleasant personality.  Now she is known as Aunt Bushie to everyone in Carlisle, and she is really related to most of them too, it would seem.<br> Arthur and Bushie Owens were the parents of four children, one girl and three boys, Mabel, George, Guy, and Frederic.  Only the youngest son, Frederic, remains at home.<br> In 1892, Arthur and his brother, Walter, along with two neighbors, who were also brothers, formed a company and purchased a sawmill and began operating it.  Later they brought out the other brothers and ran the sawmill themselves for several years.  In 1897 they bought their first piece of land, 24 1/2 acres of timber land on North River by the covered bridge.  They repaired the bridge, and it is one of the few remaining covered bridges in Iowa.  In 1902 and 1903, Arthur and Walter bought 168 acres of land joining the first land.  Then they bought 40 acres of timber land near Ford, Iowa.<br> In 1912, there was a serious accident at the sawmill.  The 60 foot belt broke and an end came around and struck Arthur, lifting him off the ground, breaking his arm in two places and cracking his ribs also.  There were no autos then and he was put in the back of a spring wagon and taken the two miles to Carlisle.  After several hours of pain, the surgeon from Des Moines arrived in Carlisle.  The dining room table was stretched full length and his broken arm was set as well as possible without X-Ray and hospital life.  A stretcher was improvised and several men took turns carrying him to the Carlisle depot.  His wife and brother, Walter, accompanied him.  After a very painful journey, he reached the hospital.  His ribs were broken and lapped over each other in several places.  There was fear that pneumonia would set in.  However his healthy constitution saved him.  Nevertheless Arthur to this day cannot raise his hand as high as his throat.  He soon learned to use his left one and from that time on he did all his work with his left arm.<br> Education was Arthur's hobby.  He was a member of the Carlisle school board for 25 years and a member of the Warren County Board of Education for 12 years.  He wanted a college education for all his children and he was willing to sacrifice anything for this.  He succeeded too, and all his children grew up to be an honor and pride to him.<br> Arthur, up until the time that this happened, had not had the time for recreation, but in his later life he found time to travel quite a bit.  He loved it, and he was especially pleased by the trip to his old home in Ohio in the year 1926 with his son George and his family.  He and his wife enjoyed this trip a lot, but Arthur was disappointed to see that many changes had taken place.<br> Later George was transferred to Omaha, Nebraska.  Arthur and Bushie visited them often.  On these occasions he would travel with George all over Nebraska, wherever his business would take him.  He enjoyed these trips immensely.  Once, George and a group of his friends went duck hunting and Arthur  went with them.  Even though he was 70 years old at the time he was up and out with the best of them though they were all much younger men than he.<br> In 1925, Arthur and his wife went to Los Angeles when the Shrine Convention was held there.  Bushie spent many happy hours with her sister in California and Arthur as he had never seen a real mountain or an ocean before, had a grand time.  It is hard to imagine the pleasure this trip afforded him and his wife.  They had such good times.  Finally they came back to Des Moines after a glorious trip.<br> Arthur likes old relics and has some very fine ones.  He has an old flaxhackle with the date, 1803, on it.  He also has a large walnut board that was one of the first ones sawed in the first sawmill in Western Iowa.<br> Although Arthur is now, in 1938, 79 years old, he still walks the two miles to his farm early every morning.  He comes home at noon but goes back in the afternoon.  His son, Frederic, does all the heavy work now, but Arthur still helps with the threshing and is a regular Mr. Fix-it around the farm.  A county newspaper recently had the headline, "EVERY FARM NEEDS A GRANDPA" (This is very true indeed.).</li>
