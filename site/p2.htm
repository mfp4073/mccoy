<li id="c43.9">[<a href="s3.htm#s491">S491</a>] Obituary from Find a Grave Website, (The following obituary is found in Transactions of NY State Medical Society, 1867, and was written by C. M. Crandall, M.D. It is available at the National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Md.)<br><br>Inasmuch as no fitting tribute to the memory of one whose life ever exhibited the highest virtues that should adorn the medical profession, has as yet appeared in the published Transactions of the Medical Society, I have prepared the brief and imperfect sketch which I trust will be received by the family and numerous friends of the deceased in the spirit in which it is offered --not as being what it should be, but as the best I can accomplish under the circumstances.<br><br>Laurens Hull, M.D., was born in Woodbury, Conn., June 6, 1779. His father was Dr. Titus Hull of that town. The attention of young Laurens was directed early to medical subjects, from the fact that from his minority, his health was extremely delicate, and even so late as his 32nd year, he had frequent attacks of haemoptysis. It was on this account that he determined to make the science of medicine his study and his occupation. His early education was limited, but he made the best possible use of the ordinary advantages of a common school, to which was added some 21 days under a private tutor, which completed his preparatory instruction. At the age of 19, he entered the office of Dr. David Hull of Fairfield, Conn., remaining there about 2 years. He received his diploma as a Doctor of Medicine in 1802, and soon after removed to Augusta, Oneida County, N.Y., where he entered the office of Dr. Amos G. Hull, and continued his medical studies.<br><br>In 1803, he was married to Dorcas Ambler, of Bethlem, Conn., by Rev. Azel Backus. In September, 1804, he removed to Bridgewater, Oneida County, and commenced the practice of medicine on his own account. In 1806, he took part in the organization of the Oneida Co. Medical Society. Of the members present at that organization, Dr. Hull was the only survivor in 1864. In 1817, he was a delegate from Oneida county to the State Medical Society. In 1824, he was elected a permanent member of this Society. In 1826, he was elected Fellow of the University, and in 1827, received the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine from the Regents. During the same year, and also the year following, he was Vice President of the State Medical Society.<br><br>Dr. Hull was President of the State Medical Society in the years 1839 and 1840. His annual address in the former year was on the subject of "Quackery," and it may be boldly asserted that there are few papers in the published Transactions of the Society showing a more logical mind and a clearer view of the subject treated of. Those members of the Society who have the volume of the Transactions for 1839, will find themselves well repaid by perusing it. His subject the following year was "Improvement in Medicine," an eminently sensible, practical and ably written paper proving clearly that Dr. Hull was no anti-progressive clog upon the wheels of advancing science, but who believed fully in the doctrine of progress.<br><br>Although the subject of this memoir achieved much in the noble profession to which he devoted the best part of his active life, accomplishing enough to satisfy a moderate ambition, he also won triumphs in civil and practical life. In 1813, and again in 1825, he was elected a member of the Assembly from Oneida County, filling the position with credit to himself, and to the satisfaction of his constituents. In 1816, he was a delegate to the first State convention held in this state to nominate a governor and lieutenant governor. In the year 1836, he removed to Angelica, Allegany county, and became interested in manufacturing pursuits, pretty much abandoning the practice of medicine. In 1837, he was elected State Senator from the Sixth district, then comprising nine counties. This position he filled with great credit. Those who were associated with him in senatorial duties and in the court for the correction of errors, of which Senators were then, ex officio, members, bear testimony to the zeal and fidelity with which he discharged every public duty, carrying with him in the responsible position he had been called to fill, the same steady virtue and unbending integrity that had ever characterized his private life.<br><br>About 1856-57, Dr. Hull retired from active business, hoping to spend the remainder of his days in the quiet walks of domestic life. In May, 1858, he was greatly afflicted by the death of his estimable wife, after a union of nearly 55 years. In August, 1862, he met with a severe accident, by which he fractured the neck of the femur within the capsuler ligament, thus rendering him permanently disable, and sadly interfering with his previously active habits, and dooming him to the use of crutches. Though a severe trial to one of his disposition and activity, he bore his affliction with a patience and fortitude alike remarkable and commendable.<br><br>During the years 1864-65, the Doctor's health began to decline more rapidly, and he was finally confined to his room. With the failure of his physical energies, his mental faculties gradually grew weak, his mind frequently wandering, dwelling much upon friends and scenes in the long past. On his 86th birthday, however, he conversed rationally and clearly for some hours with his family and friends, listened attentively to the reading of a letter from Dr. Mccall, of Utica, an old and valued friend, and soon after sank into delirium which continued till an hour or two previous to his death, which occurred June 27, 1865.<br><br>Dr. Hull was a firm believer in the truths of christianity, and was ever able to give "a reason for the hope that was in him." He united with the Congregational Church soon after his marriage, and at the time of his death, and for several years previous, he was president of the Allegany County Bible Society. He was always a friend and contributor to the various benevolent operations of the time. Politically, he was first a Federalist, then a Whig, and lastly, a Republican. He was gratified in the often expressed and cherished desire of his heart, to live long enough to see the great rebellion crushed, and the Federal Union preserved. The interest he took in the State Medical Society is known to all the older members, who will bear testimony to the fidelity and zeal with which he labored in the Society and in the Senate to promote its interests.<br><br>Dr. Hull was in every proper sense a self-made man -- the architect of his own fortunes and position. He possessed a remarkably retentive memory, great perseverance and energy. What he did, he "did with his whole might." His industry was untiring, his faith unswerving, his integrity unyielding. As a physician, he performed every duty his position imposed, as a politician in public life, he was animated by the same high purposes; in private life, his virtues shone conspicuous; as a christian, he was devoted and faithful, dying with all its hopes of a blessed immortality. Few men, starting out upon a journey of life with the same limited advantages, have filled so many positions of honor and trust, and finished up so perfect a life. May we all, while honoring his virtues, emulate his example.</li>

<li id="c43.12">[<a href="s2.htm#s382">S382</a>] Information about Dr. Laurens Hull from the Internet, Dr. Laurens Hull was born June 6, 1779, in Bethlehem, Conn.  He was the son of Dr. Titus Hull and Olive Lewis.  At the age of 19, he studied medicine with Dr. David Hull of Fairfield, remaining there about two years.  He was licensed to practice by the Connecticut State Medical Society in May 1802.  He moved to Augusta, Oneida County, N.Y., in November of that year and continued his studies with his cousin Amos G. Hull.  He married Dorcas Ambler October 3, 1803, in Bethlehem, Conn.  The ceremony was performed by Rev. Azel Bacus.  Dorcas Ambler was born Noverber 1, 1780, in Bethlehem, Conn., the daughter of David Ambler and Olive Wildman.  (David Ambler was a member of the state legislature.  He came to Bethlehem in 1773 and died there January 8, 1808.  After his death Olive lived with Dr. Hull.  She died August 3, 1827, and is buried in the Fairview Cemetery in Bridgewater.)  In September 1804 Dr. Hull opened an office in Bridgewater, N.Y.  In 1806 he took part in the organization of the Oneida County Medical Society.  He was a surgeon in the New York State Militia during the War of 1812.  In 1813 he was elected to the state assembly as a representative from Oneida County.  In 1816 he was a delegate to the first state convention held in N.Y. to nominate a governor and lieutenant governor.  In 1817 he was a delegate to the State Medical Society and was twice reelected, each term being four years.  In 1825 he served again in the state assembly.  In 1826 he was elected a Fellow of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the University of New York.  The following year he received an honorary degree of doctor of medicine from the regents of the same university.  In 1836 Dr. Hull and his family moved to Angelica, Allegany County, N.Y.  (He was discharged from the church at Bridgewater April 23 of that year.)  According to C. M. Crandall, at that time "he became interested in manufacturing pursuits, pretty much abandoning the practice of medicine."  With his brother Andrew, he completed a woolen mill at Joncey, in September 1837.  They also erected a scythe and edge tool factory across the road from the mill.  Later, he lived in the brick building later known as the Wilson Academy.  Dr. Hull was president of the State Medical Society in 1839 and 1840, and his address (1839) on "Quackery" was considered one of the finest papers ever delivered before that body.  In 1840 his address was on "Improvement in Medicine" which was described as "an eminently sensible, practical and ably written paper proving clearly that Dr. Hull was no anti-progressive clog upon the wheels of advancing science, but who believed fully in the doctrine of progress."  From 1837 to 1841 he served in the state senate.  He served in the sixth district, then comprising nine counties.  Politically he was first a Federalist, then a Whig, and lastly a Republican.  In 1828 and 1852 he was a member of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church.  He was a member of the Congregational Church, which at that time was closely united to the Presbyterian Church.  (He was admitted to the First Congregational Church in Bridgewater, May 24, 1807.)  In his later years he was president of the Allegany County Bible Society.  In about 1856 or 1857, Dr. Hull retired from business.  In August 1862 he became permanently disable when he injured "the neck of the femur within the capsular ligament," requiring him to use crutches.  In about 1864 his health began to decline, and he was eventually confined to his room.  He died June 27, 1865, surviving his wife who had died May 4, 1857.  They are buried in Lot 516 of the Angelica Cemetery.  According to Henry Cookinham, "Dr. Hull was both in the medical societies and in the legistative bodies a constant and strenous worker for the advance and purity of the medical profession."  C. M. Crandall writes:  "Dr. Hull was in every proper sense a self-made man -- the architect of his own fortunes and position.  He possessed a remarkably retentive memory, great perseverance and energy.  What he did 'he did with his whole might.'  His industry was untiring, his faith unswerving, his integrity unyielding."</li>

John Berrien Fish. <br>On August 9, 1826 she married Rev. John Berrien Fish, in Bridgewater, N.Y. In 1835 she became ill with "some disease of the liver that afterwards affected her lungs." <br><br>Her son, Rev. Edward Fowler Fish, wrote:<br>"Mother lies buried in the little burying ground at West Hartwick, N.Y. I visited the place in 1876 and gathered from the mound that covers her dust a wild strawberry blossom. I had not seen the sacred spot for thirty-five years. Shall I ever see it again. That I cannot tell, but I shall see her soon."</li>
<li id="c45.9">[<a href="s2.htm#s565">S565</a>] Source not known, In June 1835 his wife Lucia became ill. On March 31 the following year the family moved to Hartwick, N.Y. Lucia was taken there on a bed on a sleigh. Her illness was described as "some disease of the liver that afterwards affected her lungs." She was very feeble and did not walk for a year. She was also mentally deranged for much of this period. In April John B. Fish wrote, "all the funds of the United States bank would not compensate me for passing through such a scene of trial as the past year." Lucia died July 1, 1836, at the age of 31. Her grave is in the Robinson Cemetery, just west of Hartwick.</li>

<li id="c53.4">[<a href="s3.htm#s161">S161</a>] Obituary of Derick Sibley.  Death of Hon. Derick Sibley.  A telegram to Mr. Lewis H. Alling, announces the death, this forenoon, of Hon. Derick Sibley, one of the pioneers of the Genesse Valley, lately residing with his son, J.W. Sibley, in Cincinnati.  Mr. Sibley was in the 88th year, one of the venerable men of the old stock, whose lives are prolonged that they may see the great results that follow their early labors.  He came to Rochester in the year 1818, and resided here until 1846.  One of the most energetic and active of the business men who were earliest on the ground whereon the city has since arisen, he was also a man of mark in public life. He was elected to the lower house of the Legislature of this State in the years 1835, 1837, 1838, 1840 and was a conspicuous and distinguished member of that body.  This we believe was the only public office he ever held here, but he was engaged in many enterprises which contributed to the growth of Rochester, and for a time occupied the editorial chair of one of the newspapers of the then village.   His terse, epigrammatic, gracefully written articles, exhibiting a keen wit as well as high intelligence, are still pleasant reading for those who have preserved them.  No man  was more rigidly honest in his dealings with other men than he.  When adversity overtook him, he surrendered everything to his creditors, beginning again with nothing but his accumulated capital of experience and knowledge of business and of men.  He adhered to old customs and habits with peculiar tenacity, and always wore his hair in a queue, even to his last days.  He was simple in his tastes, earnest in his work, faithful to every trust, and honored by everyone who knew him, as a man peculiarly guileless, tender and sincere.<a href="e2031.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

He Was the Oldest Living Ex-President of the Chamber of Commerce.  One of the best known and most respected of the commission men of this city died yesterday.  Mr. James W. Sibley passed away at an early hour in the morning, after about three years of suffering from rheumatism, much of the time being confined to his house and to his bed.<br> His death was announced on 'Change, of which he was at the time of his death the oldest living ex-President.  The following gentlemen, also ex-Presidents, were appointed to prepare a memorial expressing the sentiments of the Chamber:  H. Wilson Brown, Theodore Cook, John A. Gano, C.W. Rowland, Captain C.M. Holloway, W.N. Hobart and H.C. Urner.<br> Mr. Sibley was a New Englander by birth, and came to Cincinnati about 1847.  In 1849 he went into the commission business at 40 Walnut street, and carried on the business there up to his death.  In 1849 the firm was Weed & Sibley, afterward Sibley, French & Co., and after 1874, when Mr. J.F. French withdrew and went to Chicago, J.W. Sibley & Co., the principal man in the business management during Mr. Sibley's illness being Mr. J.W. Hobson.<br> Mr. Sibley had a wide reputation for his kindness in business relation, and many persons in need have been relieved through his generosity.  He was once a prominent member of the Seventh Street Congregational Church, and afterward of the Church on Walnut Hills.  He leaves a considerable fortune and several life insurance policies for large amounts in different companies.  At the time of his death he was seventy-seven years and two months of age.<br> His wife and daughter, Mrs. Mary F. Benham, were with him at the time of his death.  Mr. James H. Sibley, of Terrance Park, O.; Mr. F.H. Sibley, of Philadelphia, are his other children.

Sibley.  The following tribute to the memory of the late James W. Sibley has been communicated:  James W. Sibley died Thursday, April 6th, at his beautiful home on Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio.  He was the only son of the late Derrick Sibley, and was born in this city, where his early life was passed.  He removed to Cincinnati many years ago, but his love for his early home was keen and he made frequent visits to his friends in Rochester.  No one ever came in contact with Mr. Sibley without feeling the force of his magnetic personality.  He was a man of widest culture, and unusual grace of manner.  He married Mary Hastings, and for over half a century their lives have been the type of perfect love and good to all with who they mingled.  Mr. and Mrs. Sibley were great travelers, not only in this continent, but in Europe and the Hawaiian Islands.  So complete was their hospitality that this home that death has darkened was almost as well-known as they.  Many of Rochester's older citizens will recall Mr. Sibley well, his grace as a raconteur, his ease, his genuine Christian manhood that made him a friend to all poor and needy souls, and that has left the earth more chill without him.  He left a family of two sons and two daughters, and many grandchildren.  He was a nephew of Mrs. Edwin Scrantom and a cousin of the late Hiram Sibley.<a href="e3176.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

One of the most charming events of the week was the golden wedding anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Sibley, at their handsome residence on Grandin road, East Walnut Hills, last Tuesday evening.<br> Owing to the death of son-in-law, Mr. H.L. Benham, the invitations were restricted to a list embracing only immediate relatives, and the occasion was eminently a happy family party.<br> Mrs. Sibley, a fine-looking, youthful-appearing woman for her age, received in a handsome gown of gray faille, with soft, rich lace.  Her hair was becomingly dressed, and she looked like an old-time portrait.<br> The absence of Mrs. Frank Sibley and her pretty children was a matter of regret.  The house was exquisitely decorated, and Keppler furnished a toothsome repast.  Prominent among the guests was the officiating clergyman of half a century ago, Rev. William H. Warren.<br> The guests were:  Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Sibley, Miss C.S. Hastings, Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Sibley, Miss Henrietta Sibley, Mr. J.W. Sibley, jr., Mrs. H.L. Benham, Miss Mary H. Benham, Miss Ethel S.

A very interesting family reunion was held last evening at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. James W. Sibley, Grandin road, East Walnut Hills.  The occasion was the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage, which took place at Clinton, Oneida County, Ohio, the bride's maiden name being Mary A. Hastings.  Fortune has smiled upon Mr. and Mrs. Sibley in every way, and their children and their children's children rise up and call them blessed.<br> Their long period of married life has been passed in Cincinnati, twenty-five years of it in their old home, 445 West Seventh street.  About ten years ago they removed to their beautiful home on the Grandin road, where last night's festivities were held.  It had been intended to make it a large reception, but the recent death of their son-in-law, Mr. H.L. Benham, changed their plans, and it was entirely a family affair.<br> Among those present were Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Hastings Sibley and their two children, Mr. Frank H. Sibley, Mrs. Mary H. Lee (nee Sibley), of Philadelphia, and her little son, and Mrs. H.L. Benham and her four children.  The absence of Mrs. Frank Sibley and her pretty children was much regretted, she being in Palestine, Ill., visiting her father's family.<br> Two brothers of Mrs. Sibley were among the honored guests, Messrs. Edward Hastings and Panatt Hastings; also two nephews, Harry and Mate Hastings, sons of the late Rev. Eurotas Hastings, who was for thirty years a missionary at Ceylon, and news of whose death at his post of duty has but just reached his relatives here.  Rev. Mr. Hastings married a sister of ex-President Cleveland, and his sons have been educated by Mr. Sibley and looked after with parental direction.<br> The affair was a very handsome one.  Keppler served a handsome collation.  The house was beautifully decorated.  Mrs. Sibley is a noble type of woman, and her resemblance to the portraits of Martha Washington is often remarked. She received in a gown of steel gray satin, and with her children and grandchildren about her, was an ideal type of beautiful and benignant old age.<a href="e3173.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Sibley, East Walnut Hills, was an interesting occasion on Tuesday.  Mrs. Sibley is a stately, beautiful woman who resemblance to the portrait of Lady Washington is often commented upon, and receiving her guests in her gown of steel grey satin, stiff enough to stand alone, her beautiful white hair rolled back from her fine face, the resemblance was more marked than ever.  One must go far to find a more charming family group than Mr. and Mrs. Sibley, their two sons and two daughters, and their dozen lovely grand children.  Among those present were the sons, James H. and Frank, and their families, and the daughters, Mrs. Lee, of Philadelphia, and Mrs. Benham and children, of this city.  Other guests were two brothers of Mrs. Sibley, Mr. Edward and Mr. Panott Hastings, of Clinton, and two nephews, Harry and Mate Hastings, sons of the eminent missionary to Ceylon, the late Rev.
