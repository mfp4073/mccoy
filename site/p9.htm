<li id="c241.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 12.  Death of E. P. Hastings.  An Old Citizen of Detroit Gone.  Biographical Sketch.  Mr. Eurotas P. Hastings, one of our oldest and most esteemed citizens, died last evening at six o'clock, at his residence, No. 413 Jefferson avenue, after an illness of several weeks.<br> Mr Hastings has been for over 41 years a resident of this city, and during almost its whole existence, was President of the Bank of Michigan.  He was born in Washington, Litchfield county, Connecticut, July 20, 1791, and was therefore at the time of his death, in the 75th years of his age.<br> In 1797, when but six years of age, his father removed west with his family and settled in Clinton, Oneida county, New York.  He began his business life as clerk in a store in Oneida when about 17 years of age, and went from there to Geneva, New York, to accept a clerkship in the Bank of Geneva, of which institution he was afterwards Cashier for several years.  From this office he was called to this city in February, 1825, to accept the President of the Bank of Michigan which had then just been organized, and was the first banking institution west of Rochester, N.Y.  This position he held during almost the whole existence of the Bank of Michigan, retiring therefrom in February, 1839.  During his incumbency the finances of the country were several times in a precarious condition.  When the great panic of 1837 swept over the land and almost every other institution of its kind in the country succumbed to the pressure, the Bank of Michigan, under the management of Mr. Hastings, successfully weathered the gale.<br> In 1840 Mr. Hastings was appointed Auditor General of the State, holding the office during one term, and managing its finances with eminent satisfaction to the whole people.  After retiring from that office, we was appointed United States Pension Agent, and held the office for several years.  He was also appointed General Assignee of Bankruptcy under the old National Bankrupt law.  He occupied no other public official position.<br> During the later years of his life he has been engaged as clerk and bookkeeper for several firms in this city, and was a clerk in the District Provost Marshal's office for a year or two previous to its discontinuance.<br> In politics, Mr. Hastings was formerly a Whig and latterly a Republican.  He did not, however, take a prominent part in political life.<br> Mr. Hastings has been an active and prominent member of the Presbyterian Church during his mature life, and we believe was one of the founders of the First Presbyterian (now Dr. Duffield's) Church.  That church, when he came here was known as the First Protestant Church, in which all denominations of Protestants unitedly worshiped.  It was then under the charge of Rev. Mr. Wells, who Mr. Hastings frequently aided both in his active Christian efforts, and also assisting him in occasional pulpit ministrations.  Soon after his settlement in Detroit he was chosen a Ruling Elder in this church, which office he continued to hold until he assumed connection with the Jefferson avenue church.<br> In 1853, when the First Presbyterian Church determined to sell their property on the corner of Woodward avenue and Larned streets, Mr. Hastings was appointed one of the three special trustees to whom the real estate was conveyed, with authority and direction to sell the same, and after paying off the mortgage of about $3,000 thereon, to divide the rest of the avails between the three Presbyterian churches whose establishment was contemplated.  This division gave to the First Presbyterian Church four-tenth of the whole avails, and to the Jefferson avenue and Fort street churches each three-tenths.  The two latter were expected to be organized from the member of the First church.<br> In 1854, when the Jefferson avenue church was organized and began the erection of their church edifice, Mr. Hastings was chosen one of the first Ruling Elders of that church, and continued to perform the duties of that office up to the time of his decease.  During all that time he has been clerk of the Session of that church and the Stated Clerk and Treasurer of the Presbytery of Detroit.<br> He has, on numerous occasions, represented the Presbytery of Detroit as lay delegate in the New School General Assembly, and was chosen at the last meeting of the Presbytery, in April, as delegate to the recent General Assembly at St. Louis.  His ill health, however, prevented his attendance.<br> Mr. Hastings has always been known as a thorough, active Christian, and devoted much of his time, especially during his later years, to the advancement of the principles of the religion which he professed.  He was ever ready for every good word and work, and was one of the few men that are to be found in every church whose zeal and activity can always be relied upon.  His life was quite an eventful one, and filled with many of vicissitudes that wait upon an active business career.<br> Mr. Hastings was also a corporate member of the American Board from this State, a position he had filled for many years, but not latterly discharging any of its active duties.<br> For the past few years, Mr. Hastings has been in feeble health, but has only been confined to his room for about two months.  His suffering during his sickness were not severe, and he died very peacefully.  His disease appears to have been a general debility arising from the infirmities of age.<a href="e3127.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c241.6">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 5.  In this city, June 1st, Eurotas P. Hastings, in the 75th year of his age.  The funeral services will be attended from the Jefferson avenue Presbyterian Church, on Sunday afternoon at 3 1/2 o'clock.  Mr. Hastings has had three wives and five children, all of whom he survived.  His last wife died between two and three years since.  Of his children all died in childhood with the exception on one son, Henry, who died in the year 1850, at the age of 22 years.  His last child, a boy about nine years of age, died in the following year.  His first wife died before coming to this city, and his second wife in 1834.<a href="e3107.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c241.7">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 123-124.  He was a merchant in partnership with his brother Orlando, in Clinton, in 1816.  Two years later he became a clerk in Utica.  He then went to Geneva, N. Y., as a clerk in the Bank of Geneva.  He became cashier, and removed to Detroit in February, 1825, to accept the presidency of the Bank of Michigan, which had been organized in 1818; was the first banking institution west of Rochester, N. Y.  He was president of this bank for fourteen years, resigning in 1839.  He was elected Auditor-General of the State and served in 1840-42, doing valuable service by his financial ability.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1842 he was appointed official assignee in bankruptcy, and this office he held for the remainder of his life.  During the first few years in that position he settled six hundred cases in bankruptcy, aggregating millions of dollars.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A recent communication to the Detroit Tribune says:  "The confidence of the public in the honesty and administrative ability of Mr. Hastings was supreme, and from a very early day he was constantly called upon to act as trustee, administrator, receiver, and assignee in estates, and in cases pending in court.  So scrupulously exact was he in the performance of these duties that when the bankruptcy act of 1843 became law, he was chosen the official assignee, to act in all cases of bankruptcy.  The importance of this trust can hardly be estimated at this day, for he handled the property of every bankrupt in the State of Michigan coming within this law. Notwithstanding the vast amount of money that had passed through his hands, so little was retained by him that at the time of his death, in 1866, his estate was not administered by the probate count."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another old friend writes:  "I had the honor to know Mr. Hastings; he was very prominent in the group of consistent and honest Presbyterians of Detroit of his time.  Had Mr. Hastings and Edward Bingham, his associate in religious work, placed at ten per cent interest the money they contributed to the calls for home and outside religious work, instead of dying poor, both would have died, probably, as rich as Vanderbilt."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The following description of his personal appearance is of interest as portraying a gentleman of the old school:  "He was then (1835) 44 years of age, of medium stature, and of slender frame, being about five feet nine inches in height and weighing about one hundred and thirty pounds, with a healthy but somewhat pallid complexion.  His dark hair was then and sprinkled with gray, and his eyes were black and expressive.  He had a well-shaped head and a scholarly, clean-shaven face, and was a good-looking, prepossessing man.  He was always well dressed in orthodox black, like all professional persons, and wore a high beaver hat and black silk stock.  In cold weather his usual outside garment was a Boston wrapper, as it was called, of black or brown cloth, quilted and lined with silk, and coming below his knees.  He was quick in his motions, and cordial, cheery, and inviting in his speech and manner.  He was a man of strong likes and dislikes, but he never carried the latter beyond the limits of good sense and courtesy."</li>

Another of Cleveland's Prominent Citizens Taken to His Last Resting Place.  The funeral of Mr. Truman Hastings, an old and respected resident of Cleveland, occurred yesterday from his residence, No. 893 Case avenue.  The services, which were very impressive, were conducted by Rev. Rollo Ogden, pastor of the Case Avenue Presbyterian Church, assisted by Rev. H.B. Hartzler, of the Evangelical Messenger Association.  The deceased, during his long residence in the city, formed a large circle of friends, and a large number were present at the funeral.  The pall-bearers were: Messrs. P.M. Hitchcock, H.T. Collins, W.H. Van Tine, sr., D. Hobart, Dr. J.C. Preston, and Mr. Grant.  The remains were interred in Lake View Cemetery.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hastings was born at the village of Paris Hill, now known as Kirkland, Oneida county, N.Y.  He was a graduate of Hamilton College, which is located near his birthplace.  In the spring of 1821 he became a presbyter of the First Presbyterian Church, in Albany, an office he occupied several years.  In 1825 he was prominently identified with the First Presbyterian Church of Troy, and the next year was admitted to the bar.  In 1826 he became editor of the Troy <i>Review</i>, a bi-weekly religious journal.  Previous to his entrance into the legal profession Mr. Hastings had devoted considerable time to the study of medicine.  After practicing law for some years, principally in Buffalo and Rochester, Mr. Hastings removed to Cleveland, arriving in the city in 1867.  The remainder of his life was devoted largely to literature, he having been a valued contributor to various journals, and the author of several works.  Mr. Hastings was one of the originators and prime movers in the establishment of the Case Avenue Presbyterian Church, and was always regarded as one of its most prominent and highly esteemed members.</li>

The article was written at our request, by Truman Hastings, Esq., the only surviving member of the old Hastings family, a brother of the composer, who is now in the eighty-fourth year of his age.  We take the liberty of stating a few facts concerning this writer, to show that he had abundant means of understanding what he writes about.  All the members of his father's family were very fond of music, especially that of a devotional character, and they were all respectable performers.  In very many of their family gatherings sacred song was a very chief attraction.  From 1817 to 1825, while preparing for his ultimate profession, that of the law, Truman Hastings devoted every Winter to the same business followed by his brother and in the Summer he had charge of some church choirs.  After entering upon his profession, from 1825 to 1840 he generally had charge of city choirs, some of which had been organized and trained by his brother.  During these several periods the musical intercourse of the brothers was frequent, involving a very full interchange of thought and experience.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thomas Hastings was in the habit of submitting his early musical compositions to their family gatherings, and at a later period to some select circle or choir of skillful performers, his brother, Truman, being frequently one of the number.  For many years his compositions were severely tested in this way; but ultimately he relied upon his own judgment by personally testing them with the help of an organ.  He never gave anything to the public that had not been thoroughly tested in one of these ways.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In teaching, both the brothers followed substantially the same system.  The prominent object always was to make the music elocutionary.  To this end a distinct articulation of the words was insisted upon as a prime necessity, and equally essential did they regard the proper emphasis of the words, even when they happened to occupy an unaccented part of a musical measure.  In other words, the musical score was regarded as a mere outline like the skeleton of a sermon, to be interpreted and filled up by a strictly rhetorical use of the words, irrespective of some of the technical rules of the musical art.  In carrying out this idea Truman was the builder of the two, often going beyond his more timid brother in teaching what the latter would not.  His success in this direction drew from his brother the compliment: "Truman, I never saw any one who could bring out the power of poetry in musical expression as you can."  As an illustration of the effect of this mode of teaching, we subjoin the following instructive incident:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Truman Hastings was once employed to organize and instruct a choir in a country village.  He knew that the young people who were expected to compose the choir were mostly very gay and thoughtless.  He therefore made it a preliminary condition that the pastor and some of the leading members of the church should support his influence by personally attending the meetings.  This they reluctantly promised to do.  Previous to that time singing-schools in that village had been treated as occasions for fun and frolic.  At the first meeting the pastor and two or three lay members of the church were present according to promise.  Mr. H. called the meeting to order and invited the pastor to pray, but he declined, and so did each of the lay brothers, one of who afterwards said that he could not pray in a singing school.  Mr. H. then offered prayer himself.  When the school had mastered the difficulties of the gamut and notation, and had begun to use the words and hymns, the pupils were distinctly taught that the utterance of devotional words, even in a singing-school, involved in the sight of God an act of personal worship; and every hymn used was preceded by a careful analysis of the emotions demanded; and that absolute sincerity in their use was required by Him with whom we have to do.  In the course of a week or two, after one of these analytical expositions and brief exhortations in favor of sincerity of feeling, the solemnity was so overpowering, that although the tune and words announced were perfectly familiar, the attempt to sing them was a complete failure.  The choir broke down in the middle of the performance and instantly became silent.  The pastor and the brethren could then pray, even in a singing-school.  This was the beginning of a powerful revival of religion in which nearly every member of the choir and very many of the congregation were converted.  The influence of such teaching was not without effect in other places.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hastings' views on the subject of sacred song have not been changed, but rather strengthened during the experiences and observations of his later years.  In 1825-6, while editor of the <i>Troy Review, </i>a religious journal with a musical department, he wrote a series of articles on musical adaptation which appeared in that journal, as well as several able articles which were published in the <i>Christian Spectator,</i> and which attracted the attention of Lowell Mason, and led to an interview and a pleasant acquaintance with that eminent composer.  In all his articles Mr. Hastings insisted upon one thing, viz: the use of hymns strictly devotional, and the expression of their sentiments in song.  This is certainly the true idea, and in proportion as we realize it in our religious services, will the service of song have its true place and power in our worship.<a href="e3133.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c244.5">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 135.  In early life he taught singing schools in various places in central New York.  His system, like that of his elder brother, Thomas Hastings, made the singing of hymns the sincere expression of devotional feeling.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1867 he removed to Cleveland, Ohio, and devoted his time to literary pursuits, writing many articles for the press upon political and religious subjects.  He was also author of a book, entitled "Las of the Masses," and for some years he was a lecturer at the Western Reserve College.</li>

Lieutenant Thomas Hastings, eleventh child of Dr. Thomas and Mary Field Hastings, born January 28, 1721.  Married, 1742, Mary Belden, daughter of Joseph Belden, of Hatfield.  She was born 1723.  They removed to Amherst, Massachusetts, about 1753.  He was a farmer and a lieutenant in the militia.  He died January 22, 1787, aged 66.  His widow died July 31, 1801, aged 79.  They had thirteen children, and this is the branch of the Hastings family which his great-great-grandson, Prof. Herbert Baxter Adams, of Johns Hopkins University, has traced out in connection with his Adams ancestry.  (See pamphlet privately printed by Herbert B. Adams, Amherst, 1880.)  Professor Adams says of Lieutenant Thomas Hastings:  "He was the fourth in descent from the first settler bearing his name.  He was the youngest son of Dr. Thomas Hastings, Jr., and the third of that name in a single family."  Indeed, the name of Thomas is several times repeated among the descendants of Lieutenant Thomas Hastings.</li>
