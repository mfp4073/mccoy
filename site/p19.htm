Some of the men here did not know him as he had been ill for many weeks and had not been on duty recently.  To those of you who did not know him, we can only say:  he was a great man.  Not great, perhaps, in the sense of accomplishments - not famous, but he was great to every inmate who knew him.  Here was a man who was slow to condemn, patient, and willing to try to understand the problems of others.  One of the pleasant aspects of our stay here will be the memories of knowing Mr. Johnson.  He was wise in the way of all men who have lived a rich and full life.  He was kind and considerate as all strong men are.  Men here learned a great deal from Mr. Johnson, including the ability to see the humorous side of things, to see the best in men, and to be tolerant of others.  He maintained an intelligent relationship between officer and inmate.  He never hesitated to point out our ways that needed correcting, yet - he was never unduly critical.  Someone will assume his duties - fill his place on the roster, but no one will take his place in the hearts of the men who knew him here.  Words can not tell how deeply this touches us.  All who knew him feel a great personal loss - a deep sympathy for his family.  The Paper Staff, in the name of all inmates, extend our sincere condolence to his family.<a href="e1234.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c547.11">[<a href="s4.htm#s365">S365</a>] Biographical Information written by Samuel Wood, I was born on a farm near what is now the city of Normal, State of Illinois, October 11th, 1872.  My parents came to Colorado in 1873 and settled at a small mining camp in Clear Creek County, called Mill City, now know as Dumont. There I spent my childhood days and received what common schooling was available.  In 1885 we moved to Golden where I entered the Golden High School and graduated from there in May 1889.  The High School course at that time was a three year course. I entered the Colorado School of Mines in the fall of 1889, enrolling in the Mining Engineer Course; which I pursued for three years, making good grades in all my work, except Calculus, in which I failed.  During the summer of 1893 I worked for H. W. Hardinge at the Golden Smelter as Assayer.  In fact this job was an education in many ways.  I was janitor, bucked samples, errand boy and many other things besides assayer and chemist, all for the munificent salary of $75.00 per month.  However I received some valuable instruction in sampling high grade matte and bullion and checking against the refinery; also experience in slag analysis.  The smelter was operated for the purpose of rerunning the old slag dumps, and when silver slumped we had to quit. Owing to my failure in Calculus and the desire to become a metallurgist after my summers experience, I decided that I would go back to school and take a Junior year metallurgy course, which I did.  The following year, 1894, I expected to finish the course but became short of funds before the Xmas Holidays and dropped out, came to New Mexico, married and never felt able financially to go back and finish.  During my vacations while attending High School I worked at the Brick Works at several jobs, and spent the summer of 1889 working for Phil R. Stanhope at Dumont as a mucker at the Silent Friend Mine.  During the summer of 1890 I again worked for Stanhope, hand sorting at the Senator Mine, also near Dumont.  This job consisted in separating the vein material from occasional lump of Galena, and incidentally busting open an unwary finger much oftener that was desired. The rest of my vacations except the one with H. W. Hardinge, was spent at the Golden Pressed Brick work, where I acquired the habit of walking on my hind legs, by aid of a wheelbarrow full of brick. In November 1895 I went to Cripple Creek and started to work for W. B. Milliked '93, U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor, as Calculator.  Cripple Creek had already become a network of conflicting claims and figuring conflicting areas, intersections and ties day after day became a duty rather then a pleasure.  While I still revere Vega and his seven place tables, yet I cannot say that I am eternally devoted to him, although he is still my friend.  I worked for Milliken in the office and in the field until February, when I entered into a partnership with J. E. Benjamin at Gillett, Colorado, with the understanding that I was to assist him when overburdened with assay work, and I was to do all the surveying that would be crowding its way into our office.  We sat around most of the time watching each other starve to death until June 1896.  I had forgot to mention that I had previously worked for Mr. Benjamin in his Assay Office in the Miners Building in Denver, during the summer of 1895.  At that time the Miners Bar served a splendid free lunch with each glass of beer (so I was told). Leaving Gillett, Colorado, in June 1896, I came to Golden and went to work on my father's fruit farm near Golden. In December, I decided to pay my old chum, James Bowie '94 a visit at his home at Gallup, N. M.  I landed in Gallup December 23rd, 1896 and immediately went to work in the mine of which Bowie was Superintendent, where I became a general utility man, laid track, drove a mule and weighed coal.  February 1897 I resigned and went to work for the Crescent Coal Company as Superintendents Clerk, with the job of surveying and mapping their four mines during my spare time.  This spare time generally consisted of many sleepless night and Sunday Holidays. During the summer of 1899 the American Fuel Company purchased the property and with the rest of the personal effects I was taken over and appointed resident engineer on full pay, $90.00 per month. September 12th of that year I was married to Annie S. Cunningham, a cousin of James W. Bowie. The American Fuel Company made many improvements during the next two years and I gained much valuable experience in designing and erecting hoisting plants and tipple work, besides doing all the surveying and mapping work for the Company.  O. C. Osgood was President of the company and John T. Kebler General Superintendent. November 1901, I decided to quit the coal mines and go in business for myself.  I went to Silver City, N. M. and opened an Assaying and Engineers Office.  Copper was up and business was good.  In December I went to Santa Fe and took the examination for U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor.  It was a stiff exam, lasting three days.  Quinby Vance, Surveyor General at that time told me that I had passed the best examination of any applicant heretofore taking the examination.  I received my commission as U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor in due time and anticipated a wonderful business in the thriving district surrounding Silver City.  In a very short time copper took a wonderful slump and soon went from $0.18 to $0.09.  This completely paralyzed the mining industry and the Assaying and surveying profession soon became a precarious means of livelihood.  In order to cut down the overhead and endeavor to exist until times became better I entered into partnership with the other assay office and we immediately began to starve together instead of separately. This state of affairs continued until the summer of 1902 when I accepted a job as manager of the Faywood Lead Company, at their property near Cooks Peak.  Ralph C. Ely, Detroit, Michigan was President of the Company.  They intended to revolutionize the milling industry in the arid southwest by aid of the Hooper Dry Concentrator, which was being successfully used in concentrating graphite in the Ticonderoga district, by the Dixon Graphite Co.  I had charge of erecting a 50 ton mill, consisting of crude oil internal combustion engine, crushers, rolls, screen equipment, dryer, elevators, conveyors, concentrators, etc.; also mine development.  The ore consisting of galena and lead carbonate is a replacement in lime, consisting of stringers and pipes, mostly stringers.  Our milling ore carried from 5% to 7% lead, with low silver content. When we started the mill my troubles began.  We were short of power, our crusher capacity was too small, and our screens were eternally clogging, especially the finer sizes consisting of 100, 150, and 200 mesh silk bolting cloth; then our dryer was not a success.  However by ceaseless hard work we succeeded in getting out two cars of 50% lead concentrates.  With the equipment we had our tailing loss was too great, and the mill was filled with a cloud of dust, a constant menace to the health of the mill hands.  With the extensive changes necessary before the mill could be made a commercial success, the precarious financial condition of the company and the condition of my health, owing to lead poisoning I sent in my resignation and left, March 1903 for Golden Colorado; back to the old home on my father's fruit farm.  During the summer of 1903 I designed and built an earthen dam storage reservoir for C. C. Hemmingway, President of the First National Bank of Colorado Springs.  In August 1903 I worked for the Church Ditch Company, running preliminary ditch lines and gauging stream flow on the western slop with the view of bringing water from the western slop over Berthoud Pass to the eastern slope. My health having improved and the lure of the desert becoming irresistible I again journeyed to the southwest to examine and report on a mining prospect in the Steeple Rock Mining District 50 miles west of Silver City.  The value of this property consisted principally in the high esteem of the owners; two old and decrepit prospectors who were wont to dream dreams of past success in the mining field.  I returned to Silver City and after consultation with my partner, who was still continuing to starve to death in the assay office, we decided to close up the office and divide the liabilities.  I then proceeded to Gallup with about $1000.00 worth of IOU's, and seven dollars in change in my pocket.  Landing in Gallup, I succeeded in getting a job laying track in the Weaver Mine, under the same Superintendent for whom I worked as Superintendents Clerk in 1898.  This was in March 1904.  The Weaver mine was one of the properties of the Victor American Fuel Co.  (The American Fuel Company having consolidated with the Victor Fuel Co. of Colorado with J. C. Osgood as President and George W. Bowen as General Manager, with home office in Denver.  This was one of the best mines in the district with an output of 1800 tons per day.  A Pit Boss, Boss Driver, mule drivers and three track layers constituted the company payroll inside the mine. After working a short time as track layer, the engineer who was still working for $90.00 per month as engineer and helping the mine clerk during his spare time in the evenings quit and I was offered the job but refused, as I was making more money in the mine.  However they put me on the engineers work and kept me on the mine payroll, paying me for overtime.  I finished up the mine surveys, bringing mine maps up to date.  By this time they secured another engineer and I went back to the mine. In August 1904 the Company sent me to Carthage, N. M. to take charge of the engineering work there at $110.00 per month and expenses.  This work was under R. C. Hills, Geologist for the Victor American Fuel Company.  This work consisted in mapping the Carthage Coal Field, tracing out faults, locating and logging diamond drill holes and locating existing mines.  In addition to this work I installed hoisting equipment and screening plant for the mine.  One of the pleasant tasks connected with this job was moving a 60 H.P. Economic boiler 200 feet up a 15% incline by means of two screw jacks, a pile of ties and three Mexicans, after which we put up a 50 foot smoke stack with a 20 foot gin pole and set of block and tackle.  This was accomplished by building a crib in from the boiler on which we stepped the gin pole.  We then hooked onto the stack just above center and succeeded in raising it to a vertical position along side the pole.  There by lowering the hitch to the stack and lashing to the top of the pole we could take a lift for a couple of feet, when we would again lower the lashing.  The guy ropes anchored to Mexicans also assisted in keeping the stack in a somewhat vertical position.  To make the job more interesting a stiff breeze was blowing steadily.  I was sure one relieved and happy hombre when that stack was set down on the breaching and the guys securely anchored. Then Mr. Hills sent me down from Gallup a second hand upright boiler, completely stripped, an American Deep Well Pump and a 1000 Gal wood stave tank, with orders to set it up over a deep well (churn drill hole) in order to furnish water for the diamond drill.  I got a catalog and proceeded to find out what in my judgement would be necessary to put that boiler in condition in the way of fittings and equipment and sent out an SOS call for same.  I had 480 feet of 4 inch pipe to put down that drill hole and practically nothing to do it with.  We had a set to two and three rope blocks and a three quarter inch rope, some 7" x 12" x 20' mine timbers, two 36" Stillson wrenches, saw, hammer and axe.  We burned holes through one end of three mine timbers and made them into a tripod.  We hung the blocks at the top, run the rope over to the foot of another leg which we had rounded of with the axe in order to take a hitch around it with the rope.  We had no pipe clamps so we took two pieces of the 7" x 12" mine timbers, hollowed them out with the axe to fit the pipe, burned holes through with hot iron for two clamp bolts.  In this way we let the pipes down until the pipe coupling rested on the clamp blocks.  Then came the anxious moments.  After screwing on another length of pipe, we would have to open the clamps sufficiently to let the coupling through, thus placing all the strain on the rope, while the coupling was passing the clamp.  Finally with extreme care aided by divine providence, we succeeded in getting down the last joint without accident.  Putting in the sucker rods was child's play compared with lowering the pipe.  In the meantime the boiler fittings had arrived and with rare judgement we filled the various openings in the boiler shell with the correct fittings and apparatus.  Then came the job of erecting the wood stave tank upon the raised platform we had prepared for its reception.  Everything went well until we were ready to close the circle, when to our dismay we found that we were three staves short.  Whether they were omitted from the shipment, lost in transit or used as firewood by the freighter to make his morning cup of coffee, we did not know.  After diligent search, we found enough two by fours to fill the gap, shaping them with saw, axe and jackknife.  We steamed up the boiler, turned the steam into the pump and to our joy and surprise the outfit worked.   With the aid of a few shovel fulls of dirt and caulking make from a spare undershirt, we succeeded in getting the tank to hold water.  We then turned the PLANT over to the drill crew and went on our way rejoicing with the consciousness of a job well done. During this summer we experienced one of the biggest floods in the history of the Rio Grande River.  The river came up out of bounds and covered the surrounding country to the width of over a mile, taking out three pile bents in the center of the old rail road bridge over which we hauled coal and freight from San Antonio, the rail road station, to Carthage.  We were marooned.  Our grub supply became low, and to top all this our colored cook left between two days.  It became my privilege and duty to act as camp cook for ten hungry men for two long weeks.  Strange to say I got by and still retained the friendship of the gang. It then became my job to repair the bridge so that the teams could get over the bridge.  Fortunately the rails on the old track were spliced together and did not go out with the piling.  I also found some fine southern pine timber at San Antonio long enough to make stringers for a queen post bridge.  I succeeded in finding a carpenter with a few tools, so we went to work and framed up the bridge.  When we got everything ready we summoned all the natives in the neighborhood to help us place the bridge.  We skidded the ends of the stringers across on the rails, set up the trusses, placed the needle beams, tie rods, etc., bridge stringers and decking all in one day, while the flooded Rio Grande roared along beneath us.  In the meantime the company raised my salary to $125.00 per month plus my living expenses. In November I received a wire from headquarters to report to Gallup at once, and take over the engineering work there.  Upon my arrival at Gallup I found that the company were opening a new mine, The Heaton.  The camp was partly built, and work going on around the mine.  The tipple partly built, machinery, timber and equipment scattered everywhere, with no plans or date to work to.  Mr. Bowen, President of the company, informed me that is was my job to get this plant in shape as soon as possible.  He didn't care how I was going to do it, but get it done.  If there was anything I needed to ask for it in a hurry and he would see that I got it. This was a busy time, crowding the work during the day and getting out a set of workable plans during my spare evening.  Despite the cold disagreeable winter weather we made good time and completed the job to the entire satisfaction of the Company officials who in appreciation raised my pay to $140.00 per month.  I was now Division Engineer of the New Mexico Division of the Victor American Fuel Company, with headquarters at Gibson, N. M. During the next four years I was kept busy.  I designed and superintended the erection of a new screening plant for the Weaver Mine, after which my salary was raised to $150.00 per month.  I also had charge of equipping and opening up the Navajo Mine.  During my spare time I kept up the mine surveys and made a topographic map of the Gallup Coal Fields. In May 1908 I was sent to the Heaton Mine as Acting Superintendent.  This mine employed about 300 men and was producing 1100 tons per day, but was on the decline.  By improving the haulage, opening up pillar coal that had been abandoned, developing the low coal by long wall workings and by perfecting a loyal organization we succeeded in holding the production above 1000 tons for three years.  I was now receiving $175.00 per month free rent, lights and fuel. By this time I could see no future for the mine and felt that I would be held responsible for the inevitable decline in production, so in September 1911 I handed in my resignation and bought a working interest in the Hart Hardware Company of Gallup, where I worked for a year.  This was not satisfactory, so I sold out and opened up a plumbing, tinning and electric shop for myself.  I was doing well, employing from eight to ten men, and making money.  Became ambitious and decided that a hardware stock would fit in fine with the shop, so I took unto myself a partner and we launched out into the hardware business.  It was not a success.  It took most of the profits of the shop to keep the hardware store going.  When I left the mines I put my faithful Gurley Transit away among my souvenirs, but not for long, as some one was always making me to do some work for them.  Among them was the Diamond Coal Company who asked me to keep up their mine survey.  I did this work nights and Sundays.  So when the Diamond Coal Company asked me to take charge of the engineering work opening up and equipping their Coal Basin Mine in the spring of 1917, I sold my interest in the Hardware business and went to work for the Diamond Coal Co.  I designed and superintended the erection of the head frame, screening, plant, hoist, power plant, water works system; also laid out the camp and lighting system.  The General Electric Company furnished the steam turbines and motors, C. S. Card Iron works the screens and Hendrie Bolthoff the boilers, hoists, cages and other machinery.  You will find a cut of this plant on page 233 of Hendrie and Bolthoff's Catalog No. 99.  This job was completed during the spring of 1918.  The Diamond Coal Company did not have work enough to keep an engineer, so I decided to open up a custom engineers office in Gallup.  I secured the appointment as Town Engineer for Gallup and have done the city work for them since then.  Also have the engineering work for the Diamond Coal Company two mines and the work for the Gallup Southwester Coal Company.  I have averaged a little better than $4000.00 per year clear of office expense since that time. Since opening up my office, I have had charge the of placing 7 miles of concrete paving for the town, designed and superintended construction of a 7 million gallon circular concrete reservoir for the Town, also Imhoff sewage tank, storm and sanitary sewers, 4 concrete slab bridge, 1-70 ft. span steel truss bridge, steam electric municipal power plant and made plans for the City Hall. Among the important outside jobs I have had are the following:  Laying out and mapping the munitions area for the War Department at Ft. Wingate for the storage of 3 million pounds of TNT.  Final location and mapping of the Continental Oil Company pipe line from Gallup to Shiprock - 98 miles.  Surveying and locating mine spur and yard for the Richards Coal Company.  In charge of diamond drill prospecting for coal for W. L. Weber of Rexburg, Idaho. Construction Superintendent for Trost and Trost, Architects, El Paso, erecting Gallup Junior High School.  Land locations for the Midwest, P & R. and Marland Oil Companies. I was elected and served two years as County Surveyor. This completes the record to date.

Harold Wood, known to close friends here at "Pete," was born at Heaton and grew to manhood in this community, attending the Gallup high school and graduating at the University of New Mexico.  His university course was interrupted by a period as a construction engineer in Panama.  Following his graduation he spent some time with the Indian service at Albuquerque, where he met and married Miss Doris Whitney.  They had two children, a son who died in infancy and a son now eight years of age. Wood enlisted early in the war and spend two years overseas in the navy.  He had only recently been assigned to duty at Port Chicago, and Mrs. Wood had sold their home in Albuquerque and joined him there about six weeks before the disaster at the port occurred.  His mother was also making her home with them.  It is understood they will remain there for the duration. Lieut.

<li id="c549.6">[<a href="s4.htm#s364">S364</a>]  <i>Memoir of Harold Aaron Wood</i>, HAROLD AARON WOOD, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.  Died July 17, 1944. Harold Aaron "Pete" Wood, son of Samuel Emmor and Anne (Scott) Wood, was born in Gallup, N. Mex., on May 12, 1904. After graduation from high school, he attended the university of New Mexico in Albuquerque for three years. He was employed by his father's engineering firm, the S. E. Wood Engineering Company of Gallup, from 1920 to 1925. In May, 1927, Mr. Wood accepted a position with the J. G. White Engineering Corporation in Panama, as instrument-man on the location and construction of railroads, and remained there until February, 1928. The following year he returned to the United States, and, after spending a year working with his father's engineering firm in Gallup, he returned to the University of New Mexico, being graduated in June, 1932, with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. For two years following his graduation, Mr. Wood was employed by the New Mexico State Highway Department, and, from February, 1934, until December, 1934, he served as surveyor for the United States Indian Irrigation Service, Department of the Interior, in Albuquerque. During 1935 Mr. Wood spent three months as project supervisor of a malaria-control project for the New Mexico State Health Department; four months as draftsman and designer on irrigation structures for the United States Indian Irrigation Service; and three months as instrument-man for W. R. Holloway, consulting engineer of Tulsa, Okla., on the investigation of a two million dollar domestic water supply for the City of Albuquerque. In October, 1935, Mr. Wood returned to the employ of the United States Indian Irrigation Service in Albuquerque as junior engineer, being promoted to assistant civil engineer in July, 1939. When the United States entered World War II, he offered his services to his country and was commissioned a Lieutenant (jg) in the United States Navy in May, 1942. He spent a year on duty in the South Pacific, and in March, 1943, was promoted to Lieutenant, stationed at Port Chicago, Calif. On July 17, 1944, he was reported missing in the Port Chicago explosion. Funeral services were conducted in Albuquerque on August 5, 1944. Pete, as he was known to the engineers of New Mexico, and to his many business and personal acquaintances, was Secretary-Treasurer of the New Mexico Section of the Society from December, 1935, to December, 1936, and Second Vice-President from January, 1942, until he entered the Navy. To these positions he gave his usual untiring and enthusiastic effort. Work and service were enjoyable to Pete, as all those who had the privilege to be associated with him can testify. He was a registered professional engineer in New Mexico, a member of the New Mexico Society of Engineers, a Mason, and a member of Kappa Alpha fraternity (southern section). In November, 1934, he was married to Doris Whitney of Salisbury, VT. In addition to his widow, he is survived by a son, Samuel W., and his mother. Lieutenant Wood was elected a Junior of the American Society of Civil Engineers on November 28, 1932, and an Associate Member on May 17, 1937.This article is from the American Society of Civil Engineers.
