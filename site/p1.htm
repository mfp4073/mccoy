Benham, had a narrow escape from serious injury recently when he was thrown and dragged a considerable distance by a burro.  With one end of the rope tied around the burro's neck and the other end tied around his own waist, the boy was endeavoring to lead the burro when from some cause, the animal became excited and bolted, throwing the boy to the ground and dragging him for over a quarter of a mile before stopping.  While young Benham had very little clothing left on him and was a mass of lacerations and bruises at the end of the stampede, no bones were broken and he will be as good as ever with a few days.<a href="e3780.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Of interest to valley residents is the marriage of Miss Ethel Maxine McCoy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. McCoy of Chandler, and James Edward Benham of Williams, the rites having been performed yesterday morning in the Federated church in Flagstaff.  After a wedding trip to Oak Creek canyon, the couple will go to Camp Verde, where Mr. Benham will teach school, to establish their home.  (Caption under photo of bride).<br><br>Chandler Girl Becomes Bride,  Flagstaff Aug. 14&#8211;Miss Ethel Maxine McCoy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. McCoy of Chandler, became the bride of James Edward Benham, son of Mr. and Mrs. Henry L. Benham of Williams, in a ceremony performed early this morning in the Federated church here.  The rites were read by the Rev. Ray W. Ragsdale before an alter banked with potted plants, fern and wild summer flowers.  The bride was given in marriage by her uncle, Dr. Kramer M. Gilbert of Chandler and her sister, Miss Enid McCoy, who came from her home in Los Angeles for the ceremony, was her maid of honor.  Henry Benham of Winslow, brother of the bridegroom, was the best man.  The bride wore a white satin princess gown made with cowl neckline and a redingote of satin and lace.  The redingote was fashioned with Elizabethan collar, long, tight-fitting lace sleeves and a long train.  She wore a Juliet cap trimmed with seed pearls and a full-length circular face veil of tulle edged with lace.  Her flowers were white gladioli and ferns.  The maid of honor wore a canary yellow silk lace frock over a taffeta slip.  She carried a shower bouquet of blue delphinium.  Bridesmaids were Miss Guinola Robinson of Coolidge, who wore pink lace over taffeta, Miss Dorothy Fain of Williams, who wore blue eyelet embroidery, Miss Dorothy Parkhurst of Chandler, wearing orchid net over satin, and Miss Elizabeth Gholson of Chandler in silver green organza over taffeta.  Each carried French boutonniere hand bouquets of varicolored sweet peas.  Ushers were William Armstrong of Yuma, Rannel Jones of Hope, N.M., Clifford Armack and Tom Rittenhouse, both of Williams.  Mrs. Eldon A. Ardrey, organist, played "The Bridal Chorus" from "Lohengrin" as the processional and Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" as the recessional.  During the ceremony she played "I Love You Truly" softly.  Miss Elizabeth Phelps of Mesa sang Cadman's "At Dawning".  Following the ceremony, a wedding breakfast was served at Hotel Monte Vista to members of the bridal party and the families of the couple.  The pair left for a 10-day wedding trip to Oak Creek Canyon.  The newlyweds will establish their home in Camp Verde, where Mr. Benham is teacher of science, mathematics and music in the Camp Verde high school.  The wedding was the culmination of a romance which began when the bride and bridegroom were students at Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff.  The bride, a graduate of Chandler high school, will be graduated from the Flagstaff college next June.  Mr. Benham received his education at Williams and during his junior year of high school attended the New Mexico Military Institute at Roswell.  He is a graduate of the teachers college and taught in Flagstaff last year.<a href="e1005.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c1.15">[<a href="s1.htm#s485">S485</a>] Personal knowledge of Jim Benham, The following provides a brief biographical sketch of James Benham, better known as Jimmy.  It is part of a larger document intended for what would have been his grandchildren.  It was primarily written by his son Jim Benham and daughter Barbara Benham Dittmann in the fall of 2009.<br><br>Your grandfather, usually called Jimmy, was born on April 25th, 1915. He was born on the Benham Ranch in Coconino County, just south of the town of Williams Arizona. He was born in the same house that existed until 2007 when it was torn down to build a new house on the same location. It has been told that the house consisted, at that time, of a single room, just the kitchen. Later on a living room and bedrooms were added, and the story goes that Jimmy helped to build the fireplace that was the source of heat for the house, along with the wood burning stove in the kitchen.  It is also said that he helped to dig the well and the trench for the sewage system pipe to the ditch across the road. Jimmy grew up on the ranch learning to ride and rope, just like any cowboy.<br><br>Your grandfather, Jimmy, went to school in Williams.  For at least one class, he had his mother for a teacher.  Surely she did not cut him any slack.  For his junior year of high school he was sent to the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico. There is a picture of him in the N.M.M.I. yearbook, The Bronco, showing him with a bugle.  He graduated from Williams High School in June 1932.  He went to Arizona State Teachers College, now called the Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff and graduated in 1936 with a teaching credential. He played the trumpet in the band.  His major was physical sciences with minors in biology and mathematics.  We're not quite sure how he met our Mother, Ethel Maxine McCoy, but they both ended up going to school in Flagstaff.  It is believed she worked for the same professor as did Jimmy.  Ethel was born in Prairie City, Iowa and grew up in Chandler, AZ.  She graduated from Chandler High School in 1934.  Ethel was two years behind Jimmy in school.  Jimmy taught school in Williams, AZ after graduating from college for one year while Ethel continued her studies at A.S.T.C. in Flagstaff.  Ethel graduated in 1938.  She tried to graduate in 1937 after three years of work rather than the normal four years, but apparently didn't quite make it.<br><br>Ethel and Jimmy were married in Flagstaff on August 14, 1937 and honeymooned at the El Tovar Hotel at the Grand Canyon for a day before going on to Oak Creek Canyon.  Jimmy taught sciences, mathematics and music at Camp Verde but did not like teaching. Their first home was in Camp Verde, Arizona. Their grocery bill was about $5.00 per week!  Sometime in 1939 Jimmy also attended a Refrigeration and Air Conditioning School in Chicago.  He apparently opened a business as a dealer and serviceman in Phoenix for air conditioning.  During this time they rented an apartment at 703 E Adams, Phoenix, Arizona.  This venture did not work out; Ethel and Jimmy moved back to live with his parents in Williams, AZ.<br><br>Ethel has told the story that she gave Jimmy an ultimatum:  move to California or no children.  This ultimatum was prompted by the 1939 death in Williams of Mary Virginia, Hank's first wife, as the result of an operation (that probably got infected).  The only doctor in Williams was said to have been drunk at the time.  Ethel's older sister, Enid, was already living in Los Angeles. She was there during the big earthquake in Long Beach in 1933. Her brother Harry McCoy and his wife Julia lived in Hollywood. Their second daughter, Harriet, was born in Hollywood in 1942. When Jimmy and Ethel came to California they first lived with Harry and Julia (probably at 4456 or 4334 &#189; Lockwood St., Hollywood, Calif.) then by at least October 1941 James and Ethel got an apartment of their own at 1210 North Westmoreland, Hollywood, California.  By February 1943 they have moved to 1214 &#189; North Westmoreland, Hollywood, California.  Their first two children, Jim, (short for James who's childhood name was Jay) and Barbara, were born while their parents lived in Hollywood.  They were born at The California Hospital in Los Angeles.<br><br>Our parents bought a house at 5915 Tobias Ave. in Van Nuys in late 1943. Jim was almost two and Barbara was nine months old. The house cost $4995.00 with a $500.00 down payment. The house had two bedrooms and one bathroom. Our father built the garage, as did all the other new homeowners. The concrete slab was provided by the builder.  Harry was born in November 1948 while our parents lived in Van Nuys.  In March of 1956 the family moved to a 3 bedroom 2 bath house at 17506 Lorne St., Northridge, California, cost $14,250.  In March of 1959 a lot was purchased on Halstead St. in Northridge for $7,500 with the intention of building a larger house. Plans were drawn up, but the house was never built.  The lot remains vacant to this day.<br><br>After coming to California, Jimmy may have attended the Warren School of Aeronautics prior to obtaining employment at Lockheed in Burbank. Harry McCoy did attend this school, got a job a Lockheed and encouraged Jimmy to do the same.  Jimmy took a course from the University of California in Tool Manufacturing and Engineering, completing it in January 1945.  This was a War Training class.<br><br>After the War Jimmy worked as a washing machine repairman at an appliance store called Sincomb Bros. at 6265 Van Nuys Blvd in Van Nuys.  He next worked at Radioplane, in Van Nuys, beginning March 21, 1949. Radioplane made drones for fighter planes to practice shooting down. He retired from Northrop (Radioplane was a division of Northrop) in Newbury Park, CA. There is some thought that he was exposed to radiation on the job, which may have caused his leukemia. His initial job was as an assembler.  He worked on a punch press and eventually became a Tool and Die Maker.  His last position was at a desk as a Manufacturing Methods Planner.  The Parachute Division of Radioplane had the contract to provide the parachutes for the early space capsules.  At the end of each flight we would all hold our breath until the capsule was safely in the water.  Fortunately the parachutes always worked.  He gave Barbara a silver bracelet with a picture of the parachute on it.  Katherine may have it now.  In August of 1967 Jimmy accepted a job at Weber Aircraft Company in Burbank.  The company made aircraft seats.  He worked at this job until February of 1970 when he was laid off.  It appears he worked next for Lockheed in Burbank from about July 1970 through November 1970.  In the months before his death Jimmy was studying computer programming at the Electronic Computer Programming Institute.<br><br>Ethel and Jimmy were members of and attended the First Methodist Church in Van Nuys, CA.  They belonged to a group of Tobias residents that played a card game called 500, which persisted even as they moved away.  It was a monthly night out for all those with children.  Later Ethel and Jimmy joined the Northridge United Methodist Church.  Jimmy was active in the Free & Accepted Masons of California, Lodge No. 450.  He was also active in the Order of DeMolay with his eldest son.  Jimmy belonged to the union and was active in it at least during some periods of his employment.<br><br>When I, Barbara, was in high school, my Mother told me that my Dad was sick with leukemia and would die from it, but no one knew when. He lived for ten years after the diagnosis. In the meanwhile, I went off to college, graduated, got married - my Dad walked me down the aisle - became a teacher and moved to San Rafael. He died on September 17, 1971 of lymphocytic leukemia, just nine months before Katherine was born. He died at the Granada Hills Hospital and is buried at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.</li>

Benham, Sr., are observing their 50th wedding anniversary at open house Sunday from 2 until 5 p.m.  The couple have spent their entire married life in the Williams area.  Out of town guests expected here for the occasion are a grandson Danny Schnell and family of Las Cruces, N.M. and a granddaughter Mrs. Bill Willsey and family of Holbrook, a son James E Benham and family of Northridge, and a niece of Mrs. Benham's also from California.  </b>With a treasure chest brimful of memories, yet with a keen eye on present day living, Mr. and Mrs. H.L. Benham Sr., of Williams will observe their 50th wedding anniversary Sunday, October 25, with an open house at their home, 208 South Fifth St., from 2 until 5 p.m.  Mr. and Mrs. Benham issue a cordial invitation to all their many friends in Williams and throughout Arizona to drop in and help them celebrate their golden anniversary next Sunday.  Mr. Benham adds that "regardless of race, creed, color or politics, folks are welcome."  The Benhams were married in Gallup, New Mexico, and came to Williams making their home first at Camp Clover Ranger station where Mr. Benham was stationed as district ranger.  In May of 1912 they homesteaded a place south of Williams, now known as the Benham ranch, and here they spent the summer months.  Mrs. Benham taught school here for a number of years, retiring in 1949.  Mr. Benham is also a retired Santa Fe railway clerk, having filled 30 years service with that company in 1948.  Since their retirement the Benhams have just taken things a little easy, and kept pace with Williams community life, both being active in IOOF and Rebekah affairs.  Mrs. Benham is also an Eastern Star.  The couple have two sons, H.L. Benham, Jr., of Williams and James E. of Northridge, California; seven grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.  Mr. Benham recalls with clarity his arrival to the Williams district.  He had been in Arizona previously, coming to the Show Low-Heber district where he served with the Forest Service during 1907-1908.  He then returned to Denver for some 18 months, and was later sent to this territory.  He traveled to Flagstaff by train.  There was no Kaibab Forest district as such then, it was all San Francisco Peaks forest.  When he got into the Forest Service office he was asked if he had seen a fire in Schultz Pass, to which he answered "yes."  In quick order he was queried as to whether or not he could find the blaze, and relieve the forester already there.  He rented a horse from Babbitt's livery stable and right away hit for Schultz Pass and the fire.  He relieved the man on duty and spent the next 28 hours fighting fire.  He recalls that this is one of the biggest fires he was on during his tenure with the Forest Service.  No wonder a little longing for the "good old days" can be detected when Benham tells of his Forest Service duties, and hunting trips of many years ago.  He says that he and his wife Katherine used to cover a district that comprised 14 townships.  They'd travel horseback, and take along pack horses or mules, or sometimes make the trip in a spring wagon.  "It was rough," he remarks, "There was very little water lots of times.  Some water was not clean, but it was always wet."  Many times they would be gone for two or three weeks.  It took an hour and one half to ride up Bill Williams Mountain from which rangers would scan the country for fires.  Upon spotting one, they would ride down (a 45 minutes trip) report the fire and set out to find it, through their knowledge of the lay of the land.  There weren't nearly so many fires because people weren't crashing around all through the woods like they are now.  Most fires were lightening caused.  Seldom did cowpunchers or sheepherders leave campfires untended, knowing the devastation of a forest fire.  "Hunting was lots more fun then," the white haired, senior citizen added.  We would form a hunting party, take a wagon, and plenty of feed for the horses.  Sometimes we'd be gone two weeks and never move camp, or never see any other hunters except those in our own bunch.  We could kill three deer, and there was no limit on turkey.  The hunting season was open from mid-September to mid-December.  He laughingly volunteered that "being married to the same person for 50 years is a tough assignment, but I tackled it."  (And we'll bet he's never been sorry of it.)  The Benhams have packed a lot of living into their 50 years of married life, and the Williams News joins the host of Friends and acquaintances in wishing this sterling couple a joyful Golden Wedding anniversary.<a href="e999.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e1000.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

There's hardly a creek or crevice, spring or bluff in the Williams area that isn't known to H. L. Benham, who helped map the country back in 1909 when he was a young Forest Service employee. He helped Will C. Barnes, Arizona historian, by furnishing information for "Arizona Place Names." BENHAM, 83, was born in Indiana, but was raised in Cincinnati.  He headed west in 1900, coming first to New Mexico. Until 1906 he punched cattle for Barnes in the Raton, New Mexico area.  In 1907 he went to work for the Forest Service.  In 1909 he was sent to Williams.  It was then he and his coworker, Willard Sevier, really got to know this country. Their ranger district covered 14 townships, and they rode horseback, and packed into every corner of it, mapping and recording canyons, mountains, trails and springs. "Our pay was $75 a month, and we had to feed our own horses," he said.  "During fire season one of us would ride to the top of Bill Williams Mountain and scan the countryside for fires.  If we saw smoke, we'd ride back down, and try to locate the fire from what we'd seen on top of the mountain. In October 1909 he took time off to go to New Mexico and marry his sweetheart, Katherine Cunningham, of Albuquerque.  Their first home was the ranger station at Camp Clover, west of Williams.  In those days it was only a log cabin. Benham stayed with the Forest Service until 1912 when he homesteaded a place in the lush meadows and tall timber country about four miles south of Williams.  In 1918 he went to work for the Santa Fe with the intention of "helping out for the winter." He retired 30 years later, in 1948, after being everything from call boy to relief agent. When stockmen left the high country during the winter, they always left their ranch houses open, he said.  One rancher, Benham remembers, had a sign over the door, "Feed your horse, feed yourself, feed the cat and cut enough wood for the next fellow." BENHAM is a lover of horses and recalls a favorite saddle horse, Buck, who lived to be 36. Among his most prized possessions is a tiny glass, gold-rimmed salt dish that was used at the 50th wedding anniversary reception of his grandparents in Cincinnati in 1890. He also has a hardback notebook, containing the genealogy of the Sibley family, his mother's branch. The book, compiled in 1858 by Edward Sibley is a history of the Sibley family from the time they came to this country from England in 1640. The Benham ranch is a refuge for wild turkey, elk, deer and sometimes bear. The Benhams spend many summer evenings observing the animals that come in close to the house. The ranch is a haven for people who like to get into the country.  Benham has constructed picnic tables and benches and permits organizations to use them for gatherings. He's known as barbecue chief in this area and has been preparing barbecues for more than 45 years.  He has been a member of the Elks Lodge for 43 years. Although he loves to talk about Arizona as it used to be, Benham is tuned to the present. Active and agile, he took his grandson deer hunting last week. The Benhams observed their 53rd wedding anniversary last month. They have two sons, Henry Jr., of Williams and James of Northridge, Calif.; eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.<a href="e2046.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c6.20">[<a href="s1.htm#s218">S218</a>] Grand Marshall.  <i>Rodeo Program</i>, page 1.  H. L. Benham Sr. WILLIAMS, ARIZONA Grand Marshal.  H. L. Benham, Sr., was born January 2, 1879 in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Benham roamed the woods and hunted quail, rabbits, foxes and squirrels along the banks of the Ohio and Little Miami Rivers.  "I went through grade school and the second year of high school before I quit and began to hunt work.  My father had died and I thought I had to," Benham recalls.  He worked at any job that was available and in 1898 he tried to enlist in the Spanish American War but was rejected because his weight of 105 pounds wasn't enough.  Later, Benham found work as an office boy where his oldest sister's husband worked.  The job was in Chicago and paid $25.00 per month for 12 hours a day.  Benham recalls that he finally worked up to $50.00 per month in April of 1900 but his health broke down and doctors only gave him three months to live. Benham came west to regain his health. He first settled in Las Vegas, New Mexico, where a job of riding as a cowboy in Northern New Mexico restored his health. By 1906 he was working as a cattle brand inspector in Gallup and Albuquerque. October of 1907 brought a new job for Mr. Benham.  He joined the Forest Service as a Ranger at Pinedale and Heber, Arizona. In March of 1908 he was sent to Denver, Colorado to direct the poisoning of Prairie Dogs on forests in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. By 1909 the Department of Interior decided that the poisoning of Prairie Dogs was their job and Benham was sent to Williams as a ranger at Camp Clover. May of 1912 brought still another job to Benham. He resigned his job with the Forest Service and homesteaded the Benham Ranch, four miles south of town on the Perkinsville road. These were all horse and wagon days with coal oil lamps and candles for light. H. L. Benham found the job that would be his final one in January of 1918.  He went to work as car clerk for the Santa Fe Railroad in Williams.   Benham recalls that he worked his way through every job in the station.  At times he was even Acting Agent for the area. In July of 1948 Mr. Benham retired from the railroad and in his own words has "been loafing ever since."  (This article appears in the 1972 program for the Williams Rodeo).</li>
<li id="c6.21">[<a href="s1.htm#s324">S324</a>] Benhams Create Game Haven.  <i>The Williams News</i>, section II, page 1. Where do some deer and elk, and even turkeys go between hunting seasons, when they want to have plenty to eat and feel safe from out-of-season snipers?  In this area they go to the ranch of Henry L. Benham about four and one-half miles from Williams.  Mr. Benham came to Williams in 1909, while working for the Forest Service.  In 1912 he began homesteading the place that many Arizonans know and love, having been a guest on the place, where the Benhams have made a picnic area, complete with tables and barbecue pit.  The "No Trespassing" signs posted around the ranch are for the uninvited who used to drive in and take over the place, leaving havoc behind them.  This year there have been no acorns from the oak trees to entice the deer up to the house, Mr. Benham says, but in other years herds of up to 38 have come in at dusk.  A patch of sweet clover has had twelve to fifteen elk feasting at one time.  Just before the turkey season opened, fifteen of them were feeding in the Benham yard, but when the hunting began, not one was around.  The largest flock of wild turkeys the Benhams have seen was four years ago at Oak Tank, but only one was seen there this summer.  Now there are so many hunters, all types of game have dwindled until there are almost none left to seek refuge on the Benham place, at any time of the year, the rancher said.<a href="e1441.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Others in the party were their son and family, Mr. and Mrs. H.L. Benham Jr. and son Mike, and Mrs. Lydia Little.  The Benhams were married in 1909 in Gallup, New Mexico, and as Mr. Benham puts it, "We came to Williams just as soon as the train could get us here."  They set up housekeeping at the ranger station at Camp Clover, which at that time was a log cabin.  Along with the log cabin went primitive living, such as carrying water.  But it all must have been good conditioning for the Benhams, for they are still hearty and active.  In 1912 the Benhams homesteaded a place south of Williams known today as the Benham ranch.  It is the scene of the annual Episcopal Church July 4 barbecue, and also a gathering place for summer outings and other organizations.  Mr. Benham has been "chief barbecuer for church and lodge barbecues for more than 45 years.   As well as having worked for the forest service, Mr. Benham is a retired Santa Fe railway clerk.  Mrs. Benham, who taught school for many years, retired in 1949.  In addition to their son who lives here, the Benhams have another son James Benham of Northridge, Calif.

<li id="c6.23">[<a href="s1.htm#s600">S600</a>] Homesteading of Yesterday, And of Today.  <i>Williams News</i>, page 6. After the U.S. Forest Service was created, the forest lands in northern Arizona were withdrawn from homestead entry.  Subsequently those who desired to homestead in this area had first to pick the piece of land that was desired and get a fairly accurate description of meats and bounds, preferably with some corner that had been established by U.S. survey.  After they had made application, the Forest Service passes on it to determine whether it would be more useful to the nation for farming purposes, or left as forest land.  There arose the demand for forest rangers to visit the land and judge whether it was best suited for farming.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rangers, at first, were drawn chiefly from cow ranches, and had no uniforms.  They were cowboys turned ranger.  Another job, and a tough one, that was tossed into the ranger's lap, was that of fighting fires.  Rangers also checked on the number of cattle run under permit on the forest land, and the number shipped out.  They also had to tally the lumber that was cut.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rangers of the early days had no roads to follow to the scenes of their tasks, but were required to find their way through the uncharted woods.  It was not an easy task.  Sevier, like Benham, found a bit of land that he desired to homestead, and turned to farming.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the hundreds of homesteads taken up in this country few are still in the hands of the original owners, and even fewer still are being actively operated by these owners.  One of the exceptions to this is the H. L. Benham homestead, south of Williams.  Mr. Benham homesteaded the place in 1912, and still lives there during the summer, and still works the place.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Benham came to Arizona in 1907 as a ranger for the Forest Service and was employed at Pinedale.  He had previously cowboyed for Will C. Barnes, and while engaged in this work had exterminated a lot of prairie dogs.  These nervy little animals added greatly to land erosion, and nibbled up more range feed than lots of the livestock.  Well, Benham's prowess as a "prairie dog poisoner" became well known, and a major part of his early years with the Forest Service were spend mixing and shipping prairie dog poison for use in Arizona and Colorado.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1909 Benham came to the Williams area, being sent first to Flagstaff because this was headquarters point for the Forest Service at that time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almost as soon as he got off the train at Flagstaff, he was dispatched to fight a fire in Schultz Pass.  He was later sent to Camp Clover and worked from this point as a ranger.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Benham homesteaded his place he was told by his superiors in the Forest Service he could not live on his homestead and continue to work as ranger, but would have to stay at Camp Clover.  With the independent spirit so common among the young men in a big country, Benham promptly quit the government service and went to live on his own place.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1918, he went to work for the Santa Fe Railway, with the intention of helping out until spring-but he didn't terminate his association with the railroad until 30 years and six months later when he retired.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During this time, although he had hired out as freight cashier, he handled every job connected with the department except baggage man.  He filled in as ticket cashier, took over the agent's duties when necessary, and in general proved an efficient and dependable employee whenever needed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For 54 years Mr. Benham has had as his companion and chief assistant his wife Katherine, whom he married in Gallup in October of 1909.  They reared a family at the old homestead, and recall with alacrity the good times of hunting, dancing, picnicking and various other get-togethers enjoyed by the folks many years ago when transportation and communication weren't as speedy as they are now.  Then people got together less often, but when they did gather it was a "high old time".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Benham has continued to farm his place, and today it is a popular picnic and barbecue site.  For more than 45 years he has prepared meat for Odd Fellows barbecues, and for the past seven years the St. John's Episcopal Church has held their annual July 4th barbecue there.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Benhams know many an interesting and amusing account of conditions in early Williams, and there's no finer story teller than the genial M. Benham.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At one time this region was an impressive agricultural center.  Early settlers grew bounteous crops of oats, wheat, corn, garden vegetables and certainly potatoes.  In the winter of 1890 more than seven tons of "Bill Williams" potatoes were shipped from here.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Spring Valley, Red Lake Valley and Garland Prairie flourished for years as farming areas.  On Oct. 1, 1914 school opened at Garland Prairie with 11 pupils and a Miss James of Prescott as the teacher.  She was a graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio.  There were more than 20 homesteaders in the Garland Prairie section then.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The folks used to gather often for dances and parties and each fall held a big barbecue at Red Lake.  The blessing of those years was ample rainfall to make possible the dry farming which was carried out successfully without aid of irrigation.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But came a change-a few dry years through which a farmer might hold out.  But it lengthened into too many years with too little rainfall.  Finally conditions worsened to send even the most determined farmer to other sections to seek a livelihood.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plows were abandoned, the homes vacated, and the school houses made shells of emptiness.  The once fertile fields gave way to range growth again and it was left to wild game, sheep and cattle.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now a new breed of homesteader has entered the act.  This is the summer resident; the two-home family that lives and works in the Phoenix-Scottsdale-Mesa-Tucson metropolitan melee, and relishes a respite in the pine braced air and the mountains.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The surrounding country bristles with summer home sites-Sherwood Forest, Kaibab Ranch Estates, and Grand Canyon subdivision.  Point any direction from Williams and you're zeroed in on a summer home.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, you can still drive through Red Lake Valley, Spring Valley and Garland Prairie and see signs of the old homesteads and small sawmills, but also visible are new homes under construction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old farms aren't shuffled into the "gone but not forgotten" category-the land is still here, it's merely been put to other use.<a href="e741.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Benham is taking his 90th birthday anniversary in stride, and speaks of plans for the immediate future.  Today, January 2, Mr. Benham is accepting birthday wishes, and shuffling through a pile of "happy birthday" cards.  Benham celebrated his anniversary a little early this year -- last Sunday while his son James and family were here from California, Mr. Benham, the James Benhams, Henry and Mike Benham and Vincent Craig got together for a birthday dinner.  Later this month Mr. Benham plans to go to Phoenix to visit an old friend, M.E. Spivey, and he chuckled "I might just go on down to Tucson and look up an old girl friend."  Benham, a native of Cincinnati, came to Arizona in 1907 as a young Forest Service employee.  He was first in the Springerville area, but in 1909 was sent to Williams, and "I haven't been able to get away," he remarked.  Mr. Benham homesteaded his place south of town in 1912, and has continued to plant a garden and field crops each year.  He has developed a park-like portion of his place into a convenient picnic grounds, and makes this available to organizations for summer picnics and parties.  His ranch is the scene of the annual July 4 barbecue, and he continues to lend his know-how of camp cookery to this event.  His place has also been a center for IOOF activities through the years, and several years ago Mr. Benham received recognition for his 50 years membership in Odd Fellows.  Following several years employment with the Forest Service, Mr. Benham worked for Santa Fe Railway in the clerical department.  After retirement from the railroad he busied himself mainly with his ranch-farm operations.  A genial host, a warm friend, and an entertaining story-teller, Mr. Benham has scores of friends and acquaintances, and the community joins in wishing him a happy birthday today.<a href="e773.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Benham, 94, well known and respected rancher, railroader, and forest ranger, will be Friday, October 26, at Community Methodist Church at 2. p.m.  Burial will be in Williams cemetery.  Mr. Benham died Oct. 22 at Yavapai Community Hospital in Prescott where he had been a patient since June.  He was a native of Indiana, but spent his childhood and early youth in Cincinnati.  He headed west in 1900, settling first in New Mexico where he worked as a cowboy for Will C. Barnes.  Barnes later authored the book "Arizona Place Names," and Benham assisted Barnes in identifying many area landmarks. In 1907 Mr. Benham went to work for the Forest Service.  He helped with prairie dog control programs in Colorado and was sent to Arizona in 1909.  It was also in 1909 that he married Katherine C. Cunningham, whom he had met previously in New Mexico.  Their first home was at Camp Clover ranger station west of Williams, where they lived in a log cabin. Benham's ranger district at this time covered 14 townships, and he worked with a partner Willard Sevier.  They rode horseback and packed into every part of their district, mapping and recording canyons, mountains, creeks and springs.  The pay was $75 a month and the men had to feed their own horses. In 1912 Benham homesteaded a place about four miles south of Williams.  In 1918 he went to work for Santa Fe Railroad.  "Just to help out through the winter," he remarked once.  His "helping out" stretched to 30 years, and he retired from Santa Fe in 1948 after serving as everything "from call boy to relief agent." Mr. Benham's wife taught school here for several years.  The Benhams were active in fraternal and church affairs, and for many years the annual St. John's Episcopal church July 4 barbecue was held at Benham ranch.  The family constructed a picnic and recreation area, and many organizations and families held outings there during the summer months. The Benhams were active in IOOF and Rebekah lodge, and several years ago Mr. Benham received a 50 year membership pin from the IOOF lodge. Even in advanced age, Mr. Benham had a young outlook, and kept active -- going deer hunting with his grandsons when he was well past the age when most men are taking things easy.  He always had a garden, worked many hours gathering and cutting firewood, and in general retained the life-long habits of a pioneer. His wife died in 1964 and a son James died in 1971.  The Benhams' only daughter died as a result of an accident when she was a teenager. Mr. Benham is survived by a son Henry L. Benham of Williams; seven grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.  Walker Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.  Friends may call at Walker chapel between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. tonight (Thursday).<a href="e2434.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Benham, Sr., are observing their 50th wedding anniversary at open house Sunday from 2 until 5 p.m.  The couple have spent their entire married life in the Williams area.  Out of town guests expected here for the occasion are a grandson Danny Schnell and family of Las Cruces, N.M. and a granddaughter Mrs. Bill Willsey and family of Holbrook, a son James E Benham and family of Northridge, and a niece of Mrs. Benham's also from California.  </b>With a treasure chest brimful of memories, yet with a keen eye on present day living, Mr. and Mrs. H.L. Benham Sr., of Williams will observe their 50th wedding anniversary Sunday, October 25, with an open house at their home, 208 South Fifth St., from 2 until 5 p.m.  Mr. and Mrs. Benham issue a cordial invitation to all their many friends in Williams and throughout Arizona to drop in and help them celebrate their golden anniversary next Sunday.  Mr. Benham adds that "regardless of race, creed, color or politics, folks are welcome."  The Benhams were married in Gallup, New Mexico, and came to Williams making their home first at Camp Clover Ranger station where Mr. Benham was stationed as district ranger.  In May of 1912 they homesteaded a place south of Williams, now known as the Benham ranch, and here they spent the summer months.  Mrs. Benham taught school here for a number of years, retiring in 1949.  Mr. Benham is also a retired Santa Fe railway clerk, having filled 30 years service with that company in 1948.  Since their retirement the Benhams have just taken things a little easy, and kept pace with Williams community life, both being active in IOOF and Rebekah affairs.  Mrs. Benham is also an Eastern Star.  The couple have two sons, H.L. Benham, Jr., of Williams and James E. of Northridge, California; seven grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.  Mr. Benham recalls with clarity his arrival to the Williams district.  He had been in Arizona previously, coming to the Show Low-Heber district where he served with the Forest Service during 1907-1908.  He then returned to Denver for some 18 months, and was later sent to this territory.  He traveled to Flagstaff by train.  There was no Kaibab Forest district as such then, it was all San Francisco Peaks forest.  When he got into the Forest Service office he was asked if he had seen a fire in Schultz Pass, to which he answered "yes."  In quick order he was queried as to whether or not he could find the blaze, and relieve the forester already there.  He rented a horse from Babbitt's livery stable and right away hit for Schultz Pass and the fire.  He relieved the man on duty and spent the next 28 hours fighting fire.  He recalls that this is one of the biggest fires he was on during his tenure with the Forest Service.  No wonder a little longing for the "good old days" can be detected when Benham tells of his Forest Service duties, and hunting trips of many years ago.  He says that he and his wife Katherine used to cover a district that comprised 14 townships.  They'd travel horseback, and take along pack horses or mules, or sometimes make the trip in a spring wagon.  "It was rough," he remarks, "There was very little water lots of times.  Some water was not clean, but it was always wet."  Many times they would be gone for two or three weeks.  It took an hour and one half to ride up Bill Williams Mountain from which rangers would scan the country for fires.  Upon spotting one, they would ride down (a 45 minutes trip) report the fire and set out to find it, through their knowledge of the lay of the land.  There weren't nearly so many fires because people weren't crashing around all through the woods like they are now.  Most fires were lightening caused.  Seldom did cowpunchers or sheepherders leave campfires untended, knowing the devastation of a forest fire.  "Hunting was lots more fun then," the white haired, senior citizen added.  We would form a hunting party, take a wagon, and plenty of feed for the horses.  Sometimes we'd be gone two weeks and never move camp, or never see any other hunters except those in our own bunch.  We could kill three deer, and there was no limit on turkey.  The hunting season was open from mid-September to mid-December.  He laughingly volunteered that "being married to the same person for 50 years is a tough assignment, but I tackled it."  (And we'll bet he's never been sorry of it.)  The Benhams have packed a lot of living into their 50 years of married life, and the Williams News joins the host of Friends and acquaintances in wishing this sterling couple a joyful Golden Wedding anniversary.<a href="e999.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e1000.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c7.21">[<a href="s1.htm#s17">S17</a>] Obituary of Katherine Benham.  <i>The Williams News</i>, page 1.  Services Held for Mrs. Benham, Wms. Resident Since 1909.  Funeral services were held Monday, June 29, for Mrs. Katherine Benham, 81, who died Friday evening at Williams Hospital.  Services were at St. John's Episcopal Church with Rev. David Trimble of Prescott officiating.  Interment was in the local cemetery. Mrs. Benham was born Katherine Cunningham, July 9, 1882, in Carthage, New Mexico, a community that no longer exists. A school teacher, she married Henry L. Benham in Gallup, New Mexico, in October of 1909.  Mr. Benham, a Forest Service employee brought his bride to Williams and their first home was at Camp Clover. Later they established a homestead south of town, familiarly known as Benham ranch, location of many community gatherings for picnics and barbecues. In 1959 the Benhams observed their 50th wedding anniversary, and on this occasion recalled their early days in Williams.  Mrs. Benham used to accompany her husband on Forest Service work as he patrolled a large district.  They made the rounds horseback, and with pack mules, or sometimes in a spring wagon. In addition to teaching school in New Mexico, Mrs. Benham also taught at Fort Defiance, Anita, and Williams.  She retired from this occupation in 1949. She had been a member of the Rebekah Lodge since 1902, and was also a member of Eastern Star. Many out of town people were here for the services, and IOOF and Rebekah Lodge members came from Prescott, Wickenburg, Winslow and Flagstaff to pay their respects. Mrs. Benham is survived by her husband Henry of Williams; two sons, Henry Jr., of Williams and James E. of Northridge, Calif.; seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren. Pall bearers were Clarke Cole, Carl Cureton, Si Gresham, Charles Way, J. C. Fain and Raymond Cox.  Gibbs Mortuary was in charge of arrangements.<a href="e2440.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c7.22">[<a href="s1.htm#s485">S485</a>] Personal knowledge of Jim Benham, written by Ethel Benham, 11 December 1989.  Katherine Carthage Cunningham Benham was a remarkable woman.  She was born July 9, 1882, and died June 26, 1964.  Her father, Alexander Cunningham, died Nov. 9, 1882, which left her mother, Margaret Bowie Cunningham, to rear six children alone.  While never easy, she managed by running a boarding house, and at times cooked for people who worked in and ran the mine. Kate was the youngest in the family and was always a good student.  In the Scottish tradition at the time, it was considered a waste of time and energy to educate women, because they would just get married and (they thought) never make use of their education.  However, she persevered, finished High School and went on to the University of New Mexico.  She took a business course in High School and worked for awhile as bookkeeper for the General Store.  She tried to borrow money to go to college, but was refused.  So, without permission from anyone, she rode the train to Albuquerque, went to the University, and got a job that paid for her tuition as well as board and room. She became a teacher, and taught in New Mexico before she was married.  In 1907-1908, she was paid $80.00 a month.  After her three children were in school, she returned to teaching, sometimes in the Elementary School, and at times teaching Math in the High School.  She was always an avid reader. She lost her only daughter at 15, but was able to see that both her boys finish college.  Her love of learning has passed on to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Succeeding generations owe a debt of gratitude to this strong-willed woman.</li>

Benham, was held at the Episcopal Church here Sunday, February 22nd, at 2:30 P. M. The Rev. Saunders of Flagstaff preached the funeral sermon.  The church was filled to capacity with friends of the deceased and her parents. Anna Margaret's death was due to the results of an accident received while mounting a horse at her home.  The details of the accident will never be known as she was alone at the time with the exception of a neighbor girl friend who was not watching Anna Margaret when the accident occurred.  Despite the very best of medical attention here and at the hospital in Gallup, New Mexico, she passed away without regaining consciousness long enough to even explain the accident. The entire community extends their heartfelt sympathy to Mr. and Mrs. Benham and to the relatives of the deceased.<a href="e2438.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

The couple is Mr. and Mrs. Henry Benham of Winslow and the bride is the former Montyne Snell [sic] of Boulder, Colo.

The couple married Jan. 29, 1942 at the old Holbrook Court House.  Hank worked as a carpenter and Montyne worked part time for the Williams Hospital, Rod's Steak House and as a Harvey Girl in town.  Hank was born on Dec. 25, 1911 just south of town.  "Dad (Henry L. Benham II) was a ranger at Camp Clover and they had a cabin where Hank was born," said Montyne.  "Dr. Melick delivered him.  He came out on a horse and buggy.  "It snowed so much he had to leave his buggy."  After the couple married they moved to Boulder, Colo., and eventually moved to Williams in 1946, which was 55 years ago.  "We've lived in this house for over 50 years," Montyne said.  The couple have had five children between the two of them.  They include Danny Schnell, from Scottsdale; Sandra Schnell, from Mesa; Mary Frances Benham, who died in Missoula, Mont., during 1958; Henry Laurens Benham IV, from Las Vegas; and Michael Benham, from Williams.</li>

Tall candles along the center aisle of the Northridge Methodist church in Northridge, southern California, were lighted in the presence of wedding guests at the marriage of Barbara Benham and William Haines Dittmann last Sunday evening.  Candelabras and large baskets of white flowers were placed on either side of the altar, where the young couple recited their vows before the Reverend David L. Sharp.  Lighting the candles was the bride&#8217;s cousin, Marilyn Gilbert of La Habra.  James Edward Benham of Northridge escorted his daughter past the carnation and ribbon-trimmed pews to meet her bridegroom, son of the Karl Frederick Dittmanns of Highland Avenue.  Barbara was wearing an empire-styled gown of white peau de sole over bouquet taffeta, with chapel train, the portrait neckline and elbow length sleeves trimmed with re-embroidered Alencon lace.  A jeweled crown held her four-tiered veil of silk illusion and she carried a cascade arrangement of stephanotis and roses with orchid corsage center.  Mrs. Richard Watson of El Cerrito was the matron of honor and bridesmaids were Mrs. Dean Griggs of Goleta, Cynthia Hubbard of Pebble Beach and Trudy Smith of Woodside.  They were gowned alike in empire-designed dresses of petal pink chiffon over taffeta.  Their headpieces wore fashioned of matching nylon and silk organza roses and they carried pink carnations and roses.  Jennifer Watson, little 4-year old daughter of the matron of honor, was a pretty flower girl in her long white dress and pink ribbon sash.  Robert Teel Dittmann was his brother&#8217;s best man and guests were seated by Kenan Clark Childers III of McLean, Virginia, Robert Hargis of Goleta and the bride&#8217;s brother, Harry Cunningham Benham of Northridge.  The Fireside Room at the church was the setting for the reception which followed.  Receiving her guests, the bride&#8217;s mother, Mrs. James Benham, wore an aqua sheath with matching accessories.  Mrs. Karl Dittmann wore a silk chiffon sheath in blended tones of green and turquoise and chapeau of green tulle.  When the newlyweds departed, the bride had donned a turquoise silk and rayon suit.  They have been spending this week in New York and are soon to fly to Munich, Germany, where both are enrolled in a language course at the Goethe Institute, to begin July 2.

William Haines Dittmann, son of Mr. and Mrs. Karl Frederick Dittmann of Piedmont, was married Sunday to Barbara Benham, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Edward Benham of Northridge.  Northridge Methodist Church was the setting for the evening ceremony, and a reception followed in the Fireside Room at the church.  Wearing a peau de soie gown with re-embroidered Alencon lace around the portrait neckline, sleeves and empire waist and a four tiered silk illusion veil held by a pearl crown, the bride was escorted down the aisle by her father.  Attending Barbara as maid of honor was Mrs. Richard Watson of El Cerrito, whose four-year-old daughter, Jennifer, was flower girl.  Mrs. Dean Griggs of Goleta, Cynthia Hubbard of Pebble Beach and Trudy Smith of Woodside were the bridesmaids.  Robert Teel Dittmann, brother of the bridegroom, was best man for William.  Ushering guests were Kenan Clark Childers III of Virginia, Robert Hargis of Goleta and Harry Cunningham Benham, brother of the bride.  Barbara was graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara where she belonged to Colonels Coeds.  William studied at Piedmont High School and also was graduated from Santa Barbara.  After spending a few days in New York, the new Mr. and Mrs. Dittmann will fly to Germany, where they are enrolled for a language course at the Goethe Institute in Munich, and then will spend a year studying and travelling through Europe.<a href="e917.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c18.16">[<a href="s2.htm#s328">S328</a>] Memorial to the life of Henry Laurens Benham, Memorial presented to George H. Thomas Post No. 13 Department of Ohio, Grand Army of the Republic, to commemorate the life and army service of our deceased comrade, Henry L. Benham. We pause again, amid the active duties of life, to note with the deepest regret, the death of Comrade Henry L. Benham, which occurred on the 28th day of August 1890, at his residence in Cincinnati O., at the age of forty-seven (47) years, and to unite in a testimonial of respect and love to his memory. Comrade Benham was a worthy and respected member of Co. B 132nd Regiment, Ohio Vol. Infantry, and served his Country faithfully and well in the hour of greatest peril, and when the services of patriotic citizens were most needed. He became a member of the Post in May 23, 1884, and was always deeply interested in the work and success of the Grand Army, to the full extent of his abilities and opportunities; as a member of the Grand Army, and as a private citizen, his record is honorable and without blemish. He was in business of perfect integrity; in friendship steadfast and devoted, and in religious belief, a sincere and humble follower of the Master. By the decree of an inscrutable Providence, to whose mandates we all must bow, he was taken from earth in the prime of life, and when his work would seem to be unfinished.  The march of life is ended, and he has answered to his name upon the Eternal roll of Patriots on the other shore. To his bereaved widow and children, whose loss is unspeakable and over-whelming, we tender our deepest sympathy, and the assurance of our life-long regard; and may the Great Father of us all, keep up in perfect peace under the shadow of His love, until the shades of life shall be forever lost, in the brightness and beauty of eternal bliss. Resolve that a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the family of the deceased, and spread upon our minutes.<a href="e1416.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e1417.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e1418.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c25.10">[<a href="s2.htm#s132">S132</a>] Obituary of James Benham.  Entered into rest, Saturday, July 21st, James Benham, aged 75 years and six months. Again we are called to mourn the loss of a valued member of community.  Mr. Benham had been a resident of Angelica nearly 30 years, coming here from Rushford in the spring of 1853 and remaining until November, 1881. Altho' never prominent in business or political circles, yet his influence was felt, and he was universally respected as a man of the strictest integrity, fidelity and high moral principle.  He united with the Presbyterian Church at an early age, and ever maintained a consistent, unblamable Christian life.  In 1861 he was elected deacon in the Pres. Church of Angelica, and in 1865 he was ordained a Ruling Elder in that church; the latter office he held as long as he lived. Year after year from the time of his early manhood, he was regularly in his place at Sabbath worship, in Sabbath School, and the weekly prayer meeting; and for many years in Penn Yan, in Rushford and in Angelica, his voice led the choir in the service of song. It was in the every-day home life that Mr. Benhams' character shone brightest.  He was the kindest of neighbors, the most affectionate of parents, the most thoughtful of husbands.  His wife was a daughter of Dr. Laurens Hull, and for her, through all the varied experiences of their married life, Mr. Benham evinced a tender love and profound respect, which are somewhat rare and always beautiful to witness.  He followed her beloved form to its last resting place in Nov. 1879, and two years later he went to Oakland, California, to spend the closing days of his life with his eldest son. A.M. Benham.  One other son, H.L. Benham, of Cincinnati, O., survives him.  He was confined to his bed for some weeks, and tho' he suffered great pain at times, his daughter in-law said no one could find it out except by asking him, he was so patient and uncomplaining.  During his illness he expressed great confidence in God as his Father, in Jesus as his Saviour, and a perfect readiness to depart and be with Christ; only praying that the earthly life might be spared till he could see once more his adopted daughter, Miss Lucia H. Fish.  Upon her arrival in Oakland, after a hurried trip across the continent, he said,  "Now there is nothing more to wait for; I am ready to go."  One day and one night longer he lingered, receiving with pleasure the messages brought from Angelica friends, enquiring with interest of the welfare of many of them, expressing again his thanks to his son's family that they had made his sojourn in California so delightful, and then he sank away into rest.

<li id="c25.11">[<a href="s2.htm#s332">S332</a>] Obituary of James Benham.  Mr. Benham was born at Bridgewater, N.Y., on the last day of the year 1806.  He died at the residence of his elder son, A.M. Benham, in Oakland, Cal, on Saturday morning, July 21st, 1883, being in his 77th year.  He was married in 1833 to Julia, daughter of Dr. Laurens Hull of Bridgewater, the Rev. Leverett Hull, an uncle of the bride, officiating.   After his marriage he removed to Penn Yan.  He afterwards had his home at Hammondsport, at Rushford, and at Angelica.  At the latter place he remained two years after the death of his wife in 1879.  For fifty years he was a Christian, and during most of the time an officer of the church and leader of the choir.  His voice was strong and sweet, and seemed the very outflow of his singularly gentle temper.  He loved music, and his home was full of it.  His house was a home for ministers, and doubtless many an one who has enjoyed his hospitality here on earth, was ready to greet him where none are ever away from home. E. F.

<li id="c25.12">[<a href="s2.htm#s636">S636</a>] Letter from James William Benham to  <i>Oakland, CA Mountain View Cemetery Association</i> dated 30 Jan 1912, Los Angeles, Cal., Jan. 30th, 1912.  Mountain View Cemetery Association, Oakland, CA.  Gentlemen:  I am writing in behalf of my father, A.M. Benham, who on October 20th, 1883, purchased from your association, lot #20, Plot #15, transaction dated July 21st, on which I find there is a marble improvement of $153.00, cement walk and other work $82.50 in addition to the purchase of the lot.  The remains of my grandfather, James Benham, are interred in this lot, but it is now the wish of my father to dispose of this lot and have the remains of his father cremated and sent to a little town in New York state where James Benham's wife's remains now lie.  Will you please give me the value of the lot at the present time and what it will cost to have the remains of James Benham cremated, and if you have the data, what it will cost to have them shipped to New York and how it is done, what permits are necessary.  A prompt reply is necessary, as I expect to return to my home in Chicago in a few days.  Very truly yours, signed: JW Benham.<a href="e3054.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c26.14">[<a href="s2.htm#s100">S100</a>] Obituary of Julia Hull.  Benham--At her home in Angelica, N.Y., Nov. 13, 1879, Mrs. Julia Hull, wife of James Benham.  Born in Bridgewater, N.Y., June 25, 1811.  She was at her death 68 years of age. Mrs. Benham was converted about the age of eighteen, and united with the Presbyterian Church of Bridgewater.  For the last twenty-five years she has been a resident of Angelica.  Although in feeble health, she was active in the service of Christ, and was at the time of her death President of the Ladies' Missionary Society of this church.  Her final illness lasted only eight days.  From the first she felt that the end was near, and rejoiced in its approach.  To her niece who asked "Do you want to leave us?  Don't you love us any more?" she replied "I am going to more than I am leaving," and added that it was strange to her that we should wish her to stay.  To a friend who was bidding her farewell, she said "This is the happiest day of my life; I am going home."  Her disease was pneumonia.  At times she was distressed for breath, but in the intervals of ease she talked much.  When friends called she would not have them sent away.  "I am beyond the reach of help or harm," she said; "let them come in."  She gave directions for the disposition of her effects, for her funeral, and for her family, after she should be gone; and all so calmly that it did not seem like a death-scene.  There was neither trepidation nor ecstasy.  Her preparation for this event had been made long before.  She had often expressed the wish that her death might be like her mother's.  This wish was granted.  Having left farewell messages to absent ones, and taken leave of those who stood about her, she closed her eyes and gently "fell on sleep."  Besides her husband, she leaves two sons;  Mr. A.M. Benham of San Francisco, and Mr. H.L. Benham of Cincinnati.  E. F.
