Sanders, a veteran pilot and stunt flier, was a familiar face at air shows in the West, often flying the World War II-era fighters he had restored at his Sanders Aircraft in Chino. He was flying one of them, a Lockheed T-33, when the aircraft experienced an unexplained mechanical failure and crashed May 4, just before an air show in Roswell, N.M.<a href="e2261.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c1395.11">[<a href="s8.htm#s66">S66</a>] Obituary of Frank Sanders.  <i>The Chandler Arizonian Tribune</i>, page 1 of Section B continued on page B4.  VETERAN STUNT PILOT SOARED THROUGH LIFE    Friends Pay Tribute to ex-Chandler Man    When former Chandler resident Frank Sanders Jr. died May 4, his two sons were not the only ones to lose a father figure.    The 52-year-old veteran pilot of Tustin, Calif., known as "Dad" to his peers, was killed along with a journalist when his stunt plane crashed the day before the opening of a Roswell, N.M., air show. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.    "He had more energy than an 18-year-old," said Rick Brickert an airline pilot who flew with Sanders in air shows during the past four years. "His personality was such that he always stuck out.  He never said 'no' to anyone.  He always gave help."    "Whenever I was working on something, he'd call me up and say, 'This is wrong.  Let's work on it.  I'll help you make it right.'" Brickert, a Delta Airlines pilot from Salt Lake City, said he knew Sanders and his family for 12 years.  He said he had performed with Sanders in three shows that featured Sanders' Red Knight T-33, originally out of Williams Air Force Base.    More than 300 people packed into a hangar in Chino, Calif., last Wednesday for what Sanders' son, Brian, called a "celebration of life." During a "missing man" formation at the memorial, the Dreadnought, Sanders' racing plane, veered off upward.    "His granddaughter said, 'Look, there goes grandpa's plane to heaven,'" said Sanders' sister Evelyn Manley of Yuma.    Manley said the memorial's turnout was representative of his popularity.    "Dad meant love to them," she said.  "It was out of love and respect. They all said that having known Frank they gained something."    Sanders, who was born in Mesa and lived for 30 years in Chandler, learned to fly from his father, Frank Sr., a Chandler High School graduate and World War II pilot.  The Sanders family, who still owns the Sanders farm in Higley, are credited with helping bring aviation to Chandler.    Sanders racked up a long list of aviation accomplishments, even through a childhood accident left him blind in one eye.  Colleagues said he is best known for inventing and manufacturing smoke generators used for skywriting, trailing planes and measuring turbulence.    Sanders was chairman of several aviation safety committees including the Organizational Society of Experimental Aircraft Pilots, which recognized him for his study of the human factor in airplane accidents. Brickert said Sanders was often called upon by federal officials and crash site crews for his expertise.    Sanders, who owned Sanders Aircraft Corp. in Chino, turned out to be a success story despite a mischievous childhood, family members said.  Described as an individualist but a mediocre student, Sanders excelled in his favorite endeavors including winning a drag racing championship.    Sanders' mother, Ada of Chandler, said, "He had often said to me and others that his childhood was very special and that his life had so much success and happiness that if he was to die tomorrow he'd be happy."    Grave side services will be 11 a.m. today at the Mesa Cemetery, 1212 N. Center St.    Sanders is also survived by his wife, Ruth; another son, Dennis; and a brother, George.<a href="e2255.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c1398.15">[<a href="s8.htm#s85">S85</a>] Obituary of Vernon W. Lilley.  <i>American Aeronaut</i>, Active IAM Member.   Heart Attack Takes Vernon W. Lilley.  Vernon W. Lilley, one of the most active and respected members of IAM District 727, died from a sudden heart attack in his Burbank home last Sunday, July 17.  Brother Lilley first became a member of the union July 1, 1943, when he entered the employ of the Lockheed California Division.  He secured a withdrawal card three years later when he left Lockheed's employ and when he returned to the plant March 11, 1951, he immediately reinstated as a member.  In the past nine years Brother Lilley served the union in many trusted positions - both elective and appointive.  At his death he was the president of Local Lodge C, to which post he was first elected in December of 1958.  Because of his outstanding ability in guiding his lodge he was honored by being re-elected president last December.  He has been a member of the important Senior Board and Negotiating Committee, as well as IDL delegate (member of the governing council), Laws Committee and chairman of the District Legislative Committee.  In his capacity as Senior Chairman in Dept. 52-01, where he worked as a Material Records Investigator, he policed the contract with a tight rein.  One of the last honors bestowed upon him by the membership of his own lodge was his election as delegate to the Grand Lodge Convention, to be held in St. Louis in September.  Brother Lilley was born July 29, 1894 in Wyandot, Ohio.  He is survived by his wife Enid, a brother Carleton Lilley of Pasadena, a grandson Robert Wesley Lilley of Oakland, and a niece, Mrs. Cathleen Naoma Borup of Altadena.  IAM funeral services were read by John Snider, president of IAM District 727, with services conducted at Pierce Bros. Valhalla Mortuary, No. Hollywood, July 20.  Internment followed in Mountain View Cemetery, Pasadena.  Acting as pall bearers were his brother, Carleton Lilley, and five union friends, John Foote, George Petersen, Jim Todhunter, Hal Shean and Harold Woods.<a href="e2162.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

It appears to be a carbon copy.  At the top is written "Bessie."  This sheet is in the possession of Marilyn Gilbert Miller.<br> David Franklin Sanders, son of George and Mary Ann Sanders, was born near Vinton, Iowa, December 15, 1853.  Moved with his parents to Carlisle, Iowa, where they resided until 1870, when they moved to Adair County, where he grew to manhood.  He then came to Carlisle where he lived until his death, April 17, 1931.<br> He was 77 years, 4 months and 2 days of age.  He was the oldest of eleven children.  He leaves four sisters and two brothers; Mrs. Emma Brans, Industry, Illinois; Mrs. Susie Post, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Mrs. Ella Wold, Mount Ayr, Iowa; Mrs. Kate Ward, Los Angeles, California; J.C. Sanders, Carlisle, Iowa and Fred Sanders of Greenfield, Iowa.<br> He was married to Mary E. Owens of Carlisle, Iowa, July 29th, 1880.  To them were born five children, one son and four daughters, Mrs. Bessie Gilbert, Chandler, Arizona; Garlan Sanders, Tucson, Arizona; Mrs. Beulah Kail, Lincoln, Nebraska; Mrs. Helen Schooler, Hartford, Iowa, and Mrs. Marion Wright, Carlisle, Iowa.  He leaves nine grand children and four aunts; Mrs. Margaret Sanders of Carlisle and her three sisters of Vinton, Iowa.  The oldest of these being ninety years of age.<br> He united with the Carlisle Baptist Church when a young man and remained a life-long member.  "Dave Sanders," as he was familiarly called, simply radiated friendliness.  He was a lover of music.  For many years he was a member of the Carlisle band.  Nature had endowed him with an unusually fine tenor voice.  For many, many years he was always to be found in his place in the choir.  This Easter morning he attended the Easter Services and joined in the singing, and his voice was as fine and clear as ever.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Sanders were privileged to celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary July 29th, 1930.  He was a kind, loving husband and father, a good neighbor and a loyal citizen.  These words of James Russel Lowell seem appropriate to the life of this brother:<br> Work Done Squarely.  "The longer on the earth we live And weigh the various qualities of men The more we feel the high, stern featured beauty Of plain devotedness to duty.  Steadfast and still, not afraid with mortal praise But finding amplest recompense For life's ungarlanded expense In work done squarely, and unwasted days?"</li>

Mr. Sanders Died Friday Evening, April 17, After a Short Illness With Paralysis.  D.F. Sanders passed away Friday evening at his home here, after a few days' illness with paralysis.  His funeral was held Sunday afternoon at the Baptist church, conducted by Rev. Miller of Des Moines, and interment was made in the Carlisle cemetery.  Mr. Sanders had spent the most of his life in this community and was one of our best known and respected citizens.  For many years he was employed in the mercantile business here, and also gave his services to other important activities in the community.  His last work was caring for the cemetery until about two years ago, when because of poor health he was compelled to retire.  He was almost seventy-eight years of age and is survived by his wife, three daughters, Mrs. Bessie Gilbert of Arizona, Mrs Beulah Kail of Lincoln, Nebraska, Mrs. Helen Schooler of Hartford and Mrs. Marian Wright of Carlisle.  Also one son, Garland of Arizona, and several grandchildren.  He is also a brother to J.C. Sanders of this place.<br> Out of town friends who attended the funeral of Mr. Sanders were; Mr. and Mrs. C.S. Beymer, Frank Nicholson, Mrs. Edd Mahan, Mr. and Mrs. Harley Clement, E.W. Patterson, Carl Riley, all of Des Moines and a number of friends from the Hartford community.<br> Mrs. Hannah Lynch and daughter, Mrs. Charles Neidt, and family of Truro attended the funeral of their brother-in-law and uncle, D.F.

Sanders Celebrate Golden Wedding Anniversary at Their Home, with 96 Present.  Relatives and friends to the number of ninety-six gathered Tuesday evening at the home of Mr. and Mrs. D.F. Sanders, where they celebrated the fiftieth wedding anniversary of this worthy couple.  The affair had all been planned by their daughters, Mrs. Helen Schooler and Mrs. Marian Wright, assisted by other relatives of the family.  The lawn was beautifully decorated and lighted for the occasion.<br> An interesting program was given, over which Mrs. Bushie Owens presided, and who also gave an interesting talk, closing with an original poem of greetings and congratulations.  Mrs. Mabel Owens-Shaffer also gave an original poem of greetings from the niece and nephews, which was quite humorous as well as interesting.  Another poem was read, whose author was Mrs. Bernice Lynch-Slocum of Puente, California, which recalled many pleasant memories of the Owens family.  Music was furnished by the Carlisle band, of which four of the Owens family are members.  The number, "Put on Your Old Gray Bonnet," and "When You And I Were Young, Maggie," were especially enjoyed.  Refreshments were served, in which the gold color scheme was carried out.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Sanders were the recipients of many beautiful and useful gifts, among which was over fifty dollars in gold.  They were also remembered with flowers, greetings, etc. from friends who could not be present.<br> The out of town guests were: Frank Nicholson, Mrs. Harriet Wilkes, Mr. and Mrs. Clay Beymer and two daughters, Mr. and Mrs. George Owens and children and Mrs. Mabel Shaffer of Des Moines, Mrs. Hannah Lynch of Truro, Allen Wright and Mr. Daryumple of Riverside, California, and Miss Minnie King of Indianola.  Four of the guests present were also present at the wedding fifty years ago namely, Mr. and Mrs. Wesly Patterson, Frank Nicholson and Mrs. Harriet Nicholson-Wilkes.<br> Miss Mary Owens and Mr. David F. Sanders were united in marriage July 29, 1880, in a little log cabin near Clarkson, the home of the bride's mother, Mrs. Eliza Owens, by Rev. Thompson, a Baptist minister, and since their marriage they have resided in and near Carlisle, where they have reared a family of five children who are now known as Mrs. Bessie Gilbert of Chandler, Arizona, Garland Sanders of Tucson, Arizona, Mrs. Beulah Kail of Lincoln, Nebraska, Mrs. Helen Schooler of Hartford and Mrs. Marian Wright of Carlisle.  Mr. Sanders has been employed the greater part of his life as clerk in the mercantile business, having worked for a number of years in the B. Beaucham store.  He was also sexton of the Carlisle cemetery until a few years ago when his health compelled him to retire from active work, though now he and his good wife are enjoying fairly good health for people of their age.  They are both almost seventy-seven years of age and are still residing in their cozy little home, where they have reared their family, though during the winter months they are kindly cared for at the home of their daughter, Mrs. Helen Schooler, at Hartford, and in fact they receive the kindest attention of their entire family.<br> The entire community extend to Mr. and Mrs. Sanders heartiest congratulations on this, their fiftieth anniversary, and only hope they may be permitted to enjoy many more happy years together.<a href="e681.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Anniversary Celebrated by the Sanders"></a></li>
