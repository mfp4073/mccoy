The Buffalo <i>Courier</i> says: "The Sheffield Scientific School at Yale college has been fortunate enough to secure as its professor of physics, Dr. Charles S. Hastings, at present assistant professor of the same branch of science at the Johns Hopkins University.  Dr. Hastings may be said to be a grandson of Central New York, his grandfather having been a prominent and beloved physician of Clinton, Oneida county, where the father of the professor, also a doctor, was brought up and educated, and where the Hastings family is still held in high repute.  The professor himself was born and brought up in Hartford, Conn., and was graduated from the Sheffield school in 1870, receiving the degree of Ph. D., three years later.  After spending four years in study abroad he was appointed to his present chair in Baltimore.  Last year he and Prof. Holden, of Wisconsin University, had charge of the Government expedition to Caroline Island in the Pacific to view an eclipse of the sun.  His report of the result of his observations to the Academy of Science at its meeting a few weeks ago may be said to have created a sensation among the assembled savants, and those of his auditors who began to listen to his remarks with the idea of antagonizing his views as to the non-existence of a solar atmosphere, at his close were forced to acknowledge that he had anticipated and refuted their objections."<a href="e3144.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

The year 1890 will be long remembered in Jaffna as having removed by sudden death two prominent Missionaries.  Rev. E.M. Griffith, B.A. left us in March after an illness of only three days, and now the last day of July, Dr. Hastings has left us, after being confined to his bed for no longer a time.  A year before, he left Batticotta because unable to bear the strain of carrying on its multifarious work, besides the conduct of Jaffna College and anxieties connected with it.  The change did not give the hoped-for relief, and his health did not seem to improve.  During the first part of '90 he gradually lost ground, the unusual heat of the season seeming to especially affect him.  The liver, so often the cause of ill health in the tropics, failed in its functions, and did not respond to treatment, other complications were induced, and the harp of a thousand strings, that had kept in tune so long, suddenly failed.  In all his nearly forty four years of Missionary life he had scarcely know a sick day such that he had to take to his bed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Born in the United States the 17th April 1821, Mr. Hastings took the regular collegiate course at Hamilton College, receiving B.A. in '41, and M.A. three years later on completing his theological training at Union Seminary, New York City.  Offering his services to the Am. Board he was sent to Jaffna with Mr. William Scudder, whose wife was his cousin, and they came with Mr. and Mrs. Spaulding, who were returning to their field of labor.  They arrived 15th April 1847, and Mr. Hastings was at once set to work in the Batticotta Seminary, where he labored for nearly 5 years, when he made a short visit to America, and while there married Miss Anna Cleveland the daughter of a faithful Minister of the Gospel.  On returning to his field he was put in charge of the Seminary, but it was closed two years later in connection with the visit of the Deputation from America.  They then lived at Chavagacherry for about two years, and afterwards at Manippay for twelve years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Visiting America with his family he was asked by the promoters of a project for a College in Jaffna, to join Mr. Sanders in collecting funds for the new enterprise.  When about $10,000 had been collected, Mr. Sanders came out to begin the College, but was within a few weeks stricken down by apoplexy.  Mr. Hastings was then called to undertake it, and he put his whole heart into it.  Jaffna College thus in large measure, owes its existence to the efforts of Dr. Hastings, and its constitution and by laws, its scheme of study and its Christian character all are his work.  Whatever changes may come in the future we trust it may never lose the characteristics which he impressed upon it, both at its inception and during the 17 years it was under his management.  In 1882 Mr. and Mrs. Hastings visited America for the purpose of leaving their two youngest children and while there he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity.  They returned the next year, for the last tenth of his life, and he rounded out very nearly three score yeas and ten.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two classes of students for the ministry have studied for the most part under him, of whom four are now pastors, and four others are licensed preachers, one or more expecting soon to become pastors.  He gave his life for Jaffna, not only in that his life was spent here, and in that his life might without doubt have been considerably prolonged in his native land, but more especially in that his heart was here, and he lived for Jaffna.  When a farewell address on one occasion spoke of his going to his home land, he said he had but one home land, and that was Jaffna.  When urged to remain in America, for his children's sake, and for his friends' sake, as well as his own, and he could have had a life of ease, or of honor, he said, no, my work is in Jaffna.  His life now lives in the lives of many who were influenced by him for the truth and right living.  All that was mortal of Dr. Hastings now rests in sure hope of the Resurrection, in the grave yard at Uduvil, of which Mr. W. Walker in his pamphlet, published a few months ago, thus speaks:  "Sir William W. Hunter, in his address before the Society of Arts, spoke with feeling and with true eloquence of the <i>Campo Sancto</i> at Serampore, where lie the remains of the three great pioneer Missionaries of India, and I cannot help thinking that Jaffna has got its <i>Campo Sancto</i> too.  There rest the remains of the venerable Father Spaulding, whose term of service was about 54 years; of Mrs. Spaulding, whose term was 55 years; of Miss Agnew who was head of the Uduvil Boarding School for about 43 years; of Mrs. Howland who wrought with her husband for nearly 43 years.  Such lives cannot have been wasted or cast as rubbish to the void.  They must have helped the native people to believe, first, in their teachers, and, next in the Christ for whom the teachers spoke."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Hastings who have been associated with them in Mission work in Jaffna, four children in America will mourn his loss.  The funeral on Friday, P.M. had a large attendance from all parts of Jaffna.  Dr. Hastings had the respect and love of all.  He was one who was positive in his convictions, and his counsel was valued by all.  Of dignified and commanding presence, he worked cordially and harmoniously under a Board which became chiefly Congregational, and those of other denominations also were to him brethren in Christ.  He has entered into his rest and his works do follow him.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sorrowing family have our deepest sympathy.<a href="e3146.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c105.4">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 56.  Rev. Eurotas Parmelee Hastings, D.D.  The last day of July, 1890, was also the last day in the earthly life of Rev. Dr. Eurotas Parmelee Hastings, of Manippay, Ceylon.  In a group of fourteen children, he was the seventh son of Dr. Seth Hastings and Hulda (Clark) Hastings.  He was born in the village of Clinton, April 17, 1821.  He united with the Congregational Church of Clinton in 1838.  His preparation for college was made in the Clinton Grammer School, under the instruction of Rev. Salmon Strong.  He was graduated from Hamilton College in 1842, in a class to which honorable distinction is given by such names as Col. Edwin L. Buttrick, Hon. Theodore M. Pomeroy, Rev. Dr. Addison R. Strong, and Hon. A. Parson Willard, formerly governor of Indiana.  He was also graduated from the Union Theological Seminary in May, 1846, and in October, 1846, was ordained to the work of a foreign missionary.  About this time he was married to Anna Cleveland, eldest daughter of Rev. Richard F. Cleveland, and sister of ex-Present Grover Cleveland.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For forty-three years Dr. Hastings was a laborious and successful missionary of the American Board in the island of Ceylon, where one of his predecessors was Dr. D. Poor, whose son, Rev. Dr. D.W. Poor, a native of Ceylon, is now secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Education.  Jaffna College was established in 1871, as the out-growth of Christian schools, to satisfy the pressing demand for higher education in Ceylon, and it fell to Dr. Hastings, as its first president, to organize a course of advanced studies, in science, languages and literature, after the best American model.  The work was wisely accomplished.  Jaffna College is a Christian institution, but not denominational.  Its trustees represent the Church of England mission, the Wesleyan mission and the American board.  An unconverted instructor has never been employed in Jaffna College.  Hamilton College has furnished three instructors, in addition to President Hastings, viz:  Rev. Richard C. Hastings, now in charge of a girls' seminary at Oodooville, Irving F. Wood, now in Yale Divinity School, and William W. Wood, who is still a member of the faculty.  During his last visit in America, Dr. Hastings received $30,000 from Presbyterian and Congregational Churches in response to appeals for Jaffna College, and this amount now belongs to its permanent endowment.  A larger effort has been undertaken by the missionary sisters, Mary and Margaret W. Leitch, natives of Vermont, who, after seven years of consecrated labor in Ceylon, have secured $85,000 in England and Scotland, and hope to collect $75,000 in America.  Should this heroic undertaking be crowned with success the friends of Dr. Eurotas P. Hastings could ask for no grander monument to the memory of its first president.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the history of evangelized Ceylon, Dr. Hastings will be always honored as an impressive preacher, with social gifts that commended his pulpit utterances, as a competent, earnest, patient, unselfish teacher, who won the hearts of his pupils, as a thoughtful, far seeing organizer, who laid right foundations broadly and deeply, as an attractive example of what is best in religious and scholarly culture.  The particulars of his last illness have not yet reached Clinton.  It is only known that he died in Manippay, July 31, 1890, and was buried in the Mission Cemetery at Oodooville on Friday, August 1st.  His surviving children are Miss Mary L. Hastings, of Houghton Seminary, Rev. Richard C. Hastings, of Ceylon, Miss Caroline E. Hastings, of Toledo, O., Charles E. Hastings, of Hartford, Conn., and a daughter in Ceylon.  His surviving brothers are Dr. Panett M. Hastings, of Hartford, Conn., Frank H. Hastings, of Rochester, and Edward A. Hastings, of Clinton.  Mrs. James W. Sibley, of Cincinnati, O., is a surviving sister.<a href="e3178.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c105.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 23-24.  Dr. Hastings.  Manippay, 5th Aug. 1890.  To The Editor of the <i>Morning Star</i>. Dear Sir, I surmise that your leader this time will be on the late Rev. Dr. Hastings.  Yet I send you the following lines ruled by the thought that no notice in the <i>Star,</i> of the good Doctor could be complete without a testimony to his saintly character and noble work from some of the children of the country, for which he gave himself as a Missionary, where he worked for 44 long years, and in whose soil his remains are deposited until the day "When a trump of awful tone, Thro' the caves sepulchral blown, Summons all before the throne."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The death of Dr. Hastings has created in the minds of hundreds in Jaffna a sense of personal loss.  It is a fact that the country has lost in him an incisive personality.  How are we going to get on without his mature counsel, his kind admonitions, his benign words of encouragement, the fear and dignity of his presence, the anticipation of his approval, his spirit that moved us all as if by magic, his Christian fathership, his zeal in the Master's cause, his devotedness to work, yet, even his patriotism to the country of his adoption, are some of the many questions that many of us are racking our heads with since last Thursday.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Hastings was never given to fuss.  His work was solid in all its aspects, and the manner in which he pursued it was most quiet and unobtrusive.  He was not known as a man given up to much speech, but as one who preached the Word more through his deeds.  The heathen and the apostate and the erring Christian, he never handled roughly and with a merciless scolding; and he never showed his disgust and disapproval of their doings by keeping clear of them.  But he preferred to treat all of them in the spirit of the Master, without difference, showing the utmost kindness possible under the various circumstances, and left them to invariably see that they were dealing with one who knew them well and who besides was a thorough gentleman and an exemplary Christian.  His insight into the ways of men was so keen and his knowledge of local matters so extensive and practical that his judgments of them were very sound and unerring.  Though he was simple as a child yet it was not his <i>forte</i> to be deceived.  The young and the old, the rich and the destitute, the learned and the ignorant, men of position and those of the lower ranks, all alike flocked to him for advice and counsel on matters spiritual as well as temporal.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was rarely known to be in a hurry.  He never showed a reluctance to receive visitors how busily so ever he might be engaged at the time: nor was it his habit to put off a thing that was presented for immediate consideration to a more convenient season on the score of his having no time to attend to it at once.  Although his work in Jaffna had been, with some exceptions, all along educational, he never lost his love for evangelical work, but actually went in for as much of it as circumstances permitted.  And he never was without the active superintendence of the evangelical work of several churches hanging on his hands at one and the same time with his educational work.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the thoughts and actions, in short in the lives, of so many who owe their education to the old Seminary and the new College over which he had presided, and in many others besides, he has left an indelible impress of his genius and spirit that will self-propagate for generations to come.  Although Dr. Hastings was a strong and confirmed conservative in Missionary politics, his friends always knew him as open to criticism and conviction and ready to change when change was necessary.  Some of us, who had the privilege to sitting at his feet for thirty and forty years, know and feel that he was a great factor in our after-education, and that we owe much of our refinement and spirituality to the fact of our having come in contact with his noble character and holy nature.  He appeared in general as a man of few words and great reserve, but to those who had the prerogative of belonging to the inner circle of his native friends, he was all openness and unreserve.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His constitution was no doubt delicate, but he had the fortune of having an admirable wife who so well knew the importance of his work, and so tenderly cared for him and helped him, as if she thought that she did the best part of her missionary work, if she only lived for him and kept him aright.  And she was right.  I do not want to say much further, your space is limited.  As was said in the funeral service, we have, in Dr. Hastings, lost a leader and a captain in Israel and, may the Lord of Hosts give us another in his stead with a double portion of the blessing that rested on him, be our prayer.  I am Yours &c.  R. O. D. Asbury.<a href="e3147.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

He graduated at Hamilton College in the class of 1842, and from Union Theological Seminary in May, 1846.  The following October he was ordained to the work of a foreign missionary, and in November, 1846, he sailed for Ceylon.  After teaching for five years in Batticotta Seminary he returned to America.  He married, March 9, 1853, Anna, daughter of Rev. Richard F. Cleveland, of Clinton, the sister of Ex-President Grover Cleveland.  They sailed for Ceylon, June 1, 1853.  They returned to America in 1869, and remained for two years.  Again they went to their work in Ceylon, and spent ten years, visiting this country in 1881.  In 1882 they once more returned to India, and after the death of her husband Mrs. Hastings came home and settled near her son in Hartford, Conn.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"For forty-three years Dr. Hastings was a laborious and successful missionary of the American Board in the Island of Ceylon.  He was connected with the Batticotta Seminary for seven or eight years, the latter part of the time as its principal.  Jaffna College was established in 1871, as the outgrowth of Christian schools, to satisfy the pressing demand for higher education in Ceylon, and it fell to Dr. Hastings, as its first president, to organize a course of advanced studies in science, languages, and literature; and the work was wisely accomplished.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In the history of evangelized Ceylon, Dr. Hastings will be always honored as an impressive preacher, with social gifts  that commended his pulpit utterances; as a competent, earnest, patient, unselfish teacher who won the hearts of his pupils; as a thoughtful, far-seeing organizer, who laid right foundations broadly and deeply; as an attractive example of what is best in religious and scholarly culture."</li>

Seldom has the death occurred in this community which has so keenly touched the heart of the general public as that of our genial, warm-hearted friend and citizen, Edward A. Hastings, which occurred on Thursday morning last, Feb. 25, 1892, in his 64th year.  The deceased took cold about three weeks ago, which gradually grew worse until it finally resulted in typhoid pneumonia, terminating fatally, as above stated.  During the last twenty-four hours he was a great sufferer.  His death brings sincere sorrow to hundreds of acquaintances.  Kindest words of regret are upon every lip.  His cheerful disposition and generous heart were at all times prominent characteristics.  It may be said of him with utmost sincerity:  "To live in hearts we leave behind, Is not to die."<br> Edward A. Hastings was the youngest of fifteen children of Dr. Seth Hastings, one of the pioneers of this village, who located in Clinton in 1797.  This remarkable family was composed of the following name in the order of their birth:  John C., Sophia, George, Julia, Daniel, Seth M., (who died in infancy) Seth Parsons, Francis, Panette M., Mary (now Mrs. Sibley), Elizabeth, Caroline, Eurotas P., Frances, and Edward A.  Of the fifteen only four survive, viz.:  Francis H., of Rochester, Dr. P.m. Of Hartford, Ct., Mrs. James Sibley, and Caroline, of Cincinnati, O.<br> Edward A. began active life in the store of the late Peter Fake, and later went to New York and engaged in the wholesale trade of fancy goods and notions.  On Oct. 1, 1856, he married Miss Martha Earle, who with two children, Gertrude, wife of Fred D. Smyth, of this village, and Clinton, of Memphis, Tenn., survive him.  He remained in New York until 1872, when he removed with his family to Cortland, where he was engaged in business nine years.  Mr. Hastings returned with his family to Clinton about ten years ago, soon after the death of his brother, John C., for the purpose of settling the latter's estate, and has since resided on the place his brother left, where he has busily occupied himself in improving the same.  He was an ardent lover and a keen observer of nature, a skilled florist, a practical horticulturist and pomologist.  His genial and friendly nature at once attracted the hearty friendship of all who formed his acquaintance.  He was fond of home life and found his greatest happiness in its associations, from which he was seldom absent.  Funeral rites were observed at his late residence on Saturday morning, conducted by Rev. Oliver Owen, rector of St. James Church; committal at Clinton Cemetery.  "To know, to esteem, to love and then to part, Makes up life's tale of many a feeling heart."<a href="e3151.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c108.4">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 93.  For many years he was a merchant in New York, removing to Clinton in the Fall of 1880.  Here he occupied the house made vacant by the death of his brother, John C. Hastings<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His loving, generous, unselfish nature made him a general favorite throughout the whole family connection, and there was never a child among all the nieces and nephews who did not claim him for their very own.  Indeed, whenever "Uncle Ned" was within reach, they were always sure to help and sympathy in every project in which they were interested.  His love for animals and for pets of all descriptions was a marked characteristic, and his true kindliness of heart made him gentle and winning to even the least and most unworthy of his fellow men.  His beautiful dark eyes, which danced with mirth, would easily fill with tears of sympathy when he was moved by the misfortunes of others.  He was a rare man, and even during his last most painful illness his life-long thoughtfulness for others, and his gratitude for the smallest service, were noticeable traits.  As his pastor said at his funeral, :There was but one voice through the entire village of loving appreciation of his character, and a sense of personal loss in his death."</li>

He studied medicine and settled in Washington, Conn.  Here he married, November 10, 1779, Eunice Parmele, eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Parmele, and here eight of their family of eleven children were born, the three youngest being born after the removal of the family to Clinton, Oneida County, N. Y.  Eunice Parmele was born December 30, 1763, and died in Clinton, May 2, 1821.  She was married before she had reached her sixteenth birthday, while her husband was almost thirty-four years old.  Her portrait, painted by John Brewster in 1816, shows her to have been a fair, blue-eyed woman with delicate features, and a sweet and peaceful expression.  She is said to have been "a woman of uncommon ability and of sterling piety, and although overwhelmed with domestic cares, she was remarkably attentive to the moral and religious education of her children."  Many years after her death, one of her sons wrote thus of her:  "My mother was the home angel, always kind, considerate, loving, and helpful."  In the Winter of 1797, Dr. Hastings left his comfortable home in Washington, and, with a company of neighbors, removed his family to the then almost unbroken wilderness of Oneida County, N. Y.  The journey was slowly made upon sleighs and ox-sleds, and they arrived in Clinton in February.  This beautiful village had, at that time, few comforts to offer to the newcomers. "Cultivated fields were but partially cleared of logs and trees, while the neighboring houses were hidden by the denser forests.  The district school was a sort of lumber-box; the unfinished meeting-house like an open barn.  The people were of every sort of religious belief, and the Indian still lingered in the neighborhood."  For a physician, these first years in the new "Western Country" were full of hard work, the almost impassable roads making it necessary for him to ride long distances on horseback when making his professional visits.  His records of cases treated, and the fragments of other writing still preserved, reveal a man of superior education and intelligence, and he was often called in consultation to neighboring towns.  Dr. Hastings settled upon a farm about two miles south of the village of Clinton upon the Paris Hill road. Here he resided for thirty-three years, until his death, April 29, 1830, at the age of 85 years. In his personal appearance he was notable for his reserved and somewhat stern manner.  He was a tall, spare, and dignified man, but having withal an exceedingly kind heart and a vein of humor. He is remembered by his grandchildren as an old man pacing back and forth through his house during inclement weather, meanwhile counting his steps until he had reached a certain number of miles, which he thought sufficient exercise. They also remembered that they never claimed his attention, nor did he notice them.  He must have been fond of music, for all his children were early taught to sing, and the memory of the family gatherings at Thanksgiving time, the one great holiday of the year, was one cherished by his sons and daughters.  There are many stories of the fun and frolics which these children enjoyed in their home life, and this leads us to believe that they did not stand in fear of their father even though he appeared severe.  Dr. Hastings and his gentle, patient wife trained their children to fill useful positions in life. The two daughters married physicians, and the eldest son also became a physician.  One became eminent as a professor of music; one was a banker; one was a publisher and bookseller; one was a merchant, and two were lawyers.  Four of these children, three sons and a daughter who died in infancy, were albinos, a singularity which had never before been known in either the father's or the mother's family, and one which has never appeared in any of their descendants.</li>

He was a physician; his professional services were much sought for, and he was often called to attend patients in Boston.  On one of these calls to Boston he was suddenly taken ill; and, as tradition says, thought he was the victim of slow poison.  He lived to reach home, told his wife of his impressions, and that he should soon die; as he did, April 14, 1728, in his 48th year.  Occasionally he had served as a schoolmaster.  "A quaint, unpoetical but flattering eulogy, and an acrostic, to his memory," were written at the time of his death, by Joesphus Nash.</li>
