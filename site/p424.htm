Galligan, about 45, executive vice-president of the Fairchild Engine and Aircraft Corporation, died unexpectedly last night at the Washington County Hospital of acute embolism.  The widely-known aircraft executive underwent an operation for appendicitis at the hospital last Monday and apparently was rapidly recovering.  He was stricken suddenly yesterday.  A flying cadet in World War No. 1, Mr. Galligan rose rapidly with the growing aircraft industry during the past quarter century and held a number of important executive positions before coming to Hagerstown five years ago.  Mr. Galligan was Fairchild distributor on the west coast for 12 years and previous to that was with the Curtis-Wright Aircraft Corporation.  Just 10 days ago Mr. Galligan took part in the exercises dedicating the new Fairchild plant near the municipal airport.  He spoke briefly at the exercise.  He resided with his family at 1100 Woodland Way.  His widow and a daughter survive.<a href="e3060.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Galligan underwent an appendectomy one week ago today, and apparently was recovering satisfactorily, physicians said.

<li id="c12699.5">[<a href="s15.htm#s630">S630</a>] Newspaper article about the death of Francis A. Galligan.  <i>The Daily Mail</i>, Francis A. Galligan.  The people of Hagerstown were stunned when they picked up their newspapers yesterday morning to read of the sudden death during the night of Francis A. Galligan, a man who, in the five short years that he made this city his home, had done more for the city of his adoption than perhaps any other single individual in recent years.  Hagerstown got only fleeting glimpses of this busy man whose tremendous energies and genius in first conceiving, then in working out the most minute details with his many contacts with the federal government, made possible the expanded Fairchild industry here, which is already giving several thousand persons employment and will give work to many hundreds more in the very near future.  Mr. Galligan was a happy but tired man when he left the ceremonies that dedicated the new Fairchild unit on Saturday evening, August 23.  A few hours later he was to enter the local hospital for an appendectomy and a much needed rest.  The operation successful, he apparently was recovering rapidly and was planning to leave the hospital this week to resume the task he considered the most important in his entire career--that of feeding to Uncle Sam the trainer airplanes which are so sorely needed in training the boys who may soon be called upon to defend this country.  Only an hour before he was suddenly stricken, he had discussed with his associates his plans for the future of this rapidly growing industry in Hagerstown.  Francis Galligan gave his life for his country, say his associates, for it was his almost incredible energy and persistence in building for Hagerstown its No. 1 industry in a few years, that undoubtedly had undermined him physically.  Mr. Galligan became interested in airplanes as a flying cadet during the World War.  That war over he decided to make the building of better airplanes his life's work.  He has been connected with the airplane industry ever since.  Coming to Hagerstown in 1936, he became head of the Fairchild plant, then just one of the group of smaller diversified industries here.  Things began to happen when he took the reins, which was to culminate with the completion and dedication of one of the most modern airplane manufacturing building in the country only two weeks ago.  Over two thousand persons have already been given employment here, five or six times as many as were employed when Mr. Galligan first took charge.  And the development of this industry here as conceived by this genius is just the beginning of even greater things for Hagerstown.  There was a love for the man who worked beside him in accomplishing his plans that revealed itself on rare occasion which endeared him to those who helped make what he had done possible.  His employees recalled only two weeks ago when a group walked into his office with a beautiful American flag which they had purchased themselves to fly over the new plant, that their boss was deeply touched by their loyalty.  Then there was the occasion a year ago when he lost by death his only son, and his employees had collected a sizeable sum with which to purchase flowers, that he asked them to give the money to some worthy charity.  Hagerstown and the airplane industry is going to miss Francis Galligan.  The place of this adopted son in this community is going to be difficult to fill.<a href="e1067.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Messrs Editors: -- Many of the readers of your excellent paper may take a sad interest in noting the death of one of Painesville's old inhabitants, therefore I enclose the following:<br>Mr. Wm. Croft died at the residence of his son, Thos. H. Croft, near Minneapolis, Min., July 11th, 1869, aged 70 years.<br>He removed to Painesville, from Perry, in the year 1838.  During the following winter he, in company with many others, learned to love and trust in the merits of our blessed Savior, since which time he has been His humble follower.  After remaining in Painesville twenty years, a westward "tidal wave" carried him to La Porte, Ind., where he remained until last year.  Desiring to live with those of his children who had removed to the far northwest, he came to Minneapolis.  The change of climate brought out a liver complaint, whose presence until that time had been unsuspected.  After suffering for nearly eight months, he at last received the summons to "come up higher."  He laid down his mortal for an immortal body, calmly and peacefully as if sinking into a gentle slumber.  a fitting change for a life so nearly perfect.  E.A.B.</li>

Though not in the best of health for some years, Mr. Croft had nevertheless attended to his work and nearly every day found him at his post of duty, his paint shop, or at some place where he was engaged in re-painting a carriage. He worked as usual yesterday, but about 3 o'clock this morning he was taken with a sinking spell and three hours later he passed away. Heart trouble is given as the cause of death. The deceased was born in Cleveland, O., March 3rd, 1835, and was therefore in his 69th year. He had been a resident of this city for many years. He was a carriage painter by occupation and conducted an establishment on Madison street. At one time he was in partnership with the late C. J. Lundquist, who conducted the blacksmith shop in the same building. The deceased is survived by the wife, one daughter, Mrs. Clara Croft Henderson of Baltimore, one brother, Thomas F. Croft of Pasadena, Cal., and one sister, Mrs. A. M. Benham of San Francisco, Cal. Mr. Croft was of a quiet and unassuming disposition, always conservative in his views, a good and successful business man, an excellent neighbor, a true friend and a loving and devoted husband and father. The last sad rites over the remains will be held at 3 o'clock Monday afternoon at the family residence, 1108 Clay street. Dr. R. H. Hartley will officiate and the burial will take place at Pine Lake cemetery. Weir, Sievert & Henrys are the funeral directors.</li>

PASADENA, May 5--The death of Thomas F. Croft late yesterday afternoon, takes from Pasadena its founder, the man who at one time owned the land on which the city is now located and who organized the famous Indiana Society, the first settlers of the Crown City.  Since December 12, 1873 he was a resident.  He was the first white man to live on what is now Pasadena and his life was devoted to upbuilding one of the most delightful residential cities in the world.  He was the organizer of the famous Pasadena Pioneer Society, the records of which form a comprehensive history of Southern California.  He was born in Painesville, O., April 30, 1834, where he was educated in an academy and afterwards in a business college.  In 1854 he came to California.  For six years he was manager for Wells, Fargo & Co., at Downieville, Cal.  In 1862 President Lincoln appointed him paymaster in the United States Navy.  He was sent to New Orleans and detailed with Rear-Admiral S.P. Lee, where he served until the end of the war.  He then returned to Ohio, and later went to Springfield, Ill., where he was cashier in the Mad River National Bank until 1873.  Early in the fall of 1873 he came to Los Angeles to make his home in Southern California.  In looking about for an investment he decided that the Rancho San Pasquel, then comprising the entire mesa from the San Gabriel Mountains to the valley lands along the big wash, was a most desirable location for the establishment of a colony of eastern people who might be looking for a place for a winter residence.  In the meantime he met D. M. Berry and J. M. Baker, who had been sent to Southern California by a number of people in Indianapolis, to look for the most desirable climate for winter residences.  At that time the Rancho San Pasquel belonged to John S. Griffin and B. D. Wilson.  Judge Benjamin F. Eaton, who died in Los Angeles last fall was agent for the owners.  Croft proposed to buy out Griffin's share in the ranch but Wilson objected.  After much dickering the deal was made and Croft bought Griffin's interests amounting to 3900(?) acres for a consideration of $25,000, paying $6250 in cash and giving his note for $18,750.  This transaction took place in December 12 of that year.  In the meantime he negotiated a trade with the representatives of the Indiana Colony and two months later turned the entire tract over to that colony, which had organized under the name of the San Gabriel Orange Grove Association.  Under the articles of agreement the entire tract was divided equally among the members of the colony.  Mr. Croft received as his share, sixty acres, which land is now in the heart of Pasadena.  He was made secretary and treasurer of the association, which position he held for many years.  Mr. Croft never engaged in any active business outside of his position with the society and looking after his own interests, which were large.  Three years ago he became afflicted with slow paralysis, which finally caused his death.  Until a couple of weeks before his death, he retained control of his mental faculties.  Mr. Croft was a charter member of the Pasadena Presbyterian Church.  He was one of the organizers and a faithful member of Godfrey Post, G.A.R.  He was a subscriber to the first issue of the Los Angeles Times and took the paper every day since that time.  In I$$$(?) he was married to Miss Eurietta A. Wallace, who survives him.  There are no children.  The funeral will be held at the undertaking parlors of W. H. Pierce & Co., on North Lincoln avenue, at 2:30 o'clock Saturday afternoon.<a href="e805.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Croft of Pasadena, who died at the County Hospital May 5 was offered for probate yesterday.  According to the petition, the value of the property left by the testator is in excess of $10,000, and it all goes to the widow, Eurietta A. Croft, without reserve.  E. H. May of Pasadena is nominated as executor, and the instrument was drawn February 23, last.  There are three other heirs of Croft, but they are not remembered in the will.  For some time previous to the death of Croft, he was confined to his home at No. 90 Euclid avenue, Pasadena, in an almost helpless condition.  It was his sudden and unexpected death that had much to do with the action of Judge Bordwell in hereafter insisting that the officers connected with the insanity bureau be quite sure that persons suspected of unbalanced mind are so afflicted rather than ill from physical causes.  Croft was brought into the insanity court for examination in a comatose condition, and he never recovered consciousness, dying at the County Hospital the next day.<a href="e804.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Croft, the "father of Pasadena," as he was known because of his early settling in the Crown city, was admitted to probate yesterday by Judge Rives of the superior court. Mr. Croft died May 5 of this year in the insane ward of the county hospital, after having the day previous been before the lunacy commission for an examination. It was believed afterward that Mr. Croft, who was 70 years old, was merely ill and not insane. This will, by which he devised practically all of his estate of $10,000 to his widow, Mrs. Eurietta Croft, was dated February 23, 1910. His sister Mrs. Mary C. Benham, and two of his nephews, A. C. and Thomas V. Barnes, contested the Instrument, alleging that the dead man was mentally incompetent to make his will when he did and also that he was under the undue Influence of his wife. They also expressed their belief that some of the dead man's property&#8212; and he had been involved in many large transactions&#8212; not named in the instrument and that his estate properly should be valued at $100,000 instead of $10,000.  They later withdrew their contest and E. H. May, a Pasadena banker, was named as executor in accordance with the dead man's wishes.<a href="e834.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

May, Pasadena, as executor.<a href="e803.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c12708.8">[<a href="s15.htm#s653">S653</a>] The Past on Parade.  <i>The Daily Breeze</i>, PASADENA - Pasadena's Indiana Colony was settled not long after the Civil War. One of the settlers was Thomas Finley Croft, pictured here in 1864, who had served as an assistant paymaster in the U.S. Navy from 1860 to 1865. The late Museum of History volunteer, Mary Borgerding, wrote short bios of all the founders. She titled Croft's, "Money, Mules and Matrimony." She also wrote that he was on the Monitor when it battled the Merrimac and suffered a broken eardrum from concussion of the guns. A better title might have been, "The Man Who Bought Pasadena." A group of Indianans calling themselves the California Colony of Indiana in 1873 had sent representatives west to locate and buy property. After looking at many sites, and hooking up with early settler and water supply expert, Benjamin Eaton, the west side of the San Pasqual Rancho was chosen. They couldn't agree on price and boundaries with the owners, Dr. John Griffin and Benjamin D. Wilson. Another problem was that a financial decline caused some of the Indianans to pull out of the venture. Thomas Croft showed up after a sea voyage and took over negotiations with the help of Judge Eaton. They also recruited more investors. His diary says, "Went down to Wilmington to see Mr. Wilson about San Pasqual Ranch and am convinced that he will do anything that is right. Met Gen'l. Banning there. Am pleased with him. Judge Eaton is in town and with me."  Croft got all the legal papers made out and on Dec. 26 paid $25,000, $6250 cash and $18,750 in notes. This was for all the land from Fair Oaks to the Arroyo Seco, from South Pasadena to the mountains. Three days later, he transferred the deed to the San Gabriel Orange Grove Association.  Croft ended up with 60 acres west of Fair Oaks to the Arroyo and from California to Palmetto. Other settlers wrote that Croft with his mules did the first plowing in the colony. Croft hitched his mules to a wagon and took young people on moonlight rides. On one ride he met and later married a Canadian girl, Eurietta Wallace. Croft continued ranching and was treasurer of the Orange Grove Association until 1881. He died in 1910. Sid Gally is a Pasadena Museum of History volunteer.</li>
<li id="c12708.9">[<a href="s15.htm#s721">S721</a>] <a class="ext" href="http://pasadenahistory.org/curators-blog-cw/thomas-croft-man-owned-pasadena-day/">http://pasadenahistory.org/curators-blog-cw/&hellip;</a>, Thomas Croft: The Man Who Owned Pasadena for a Day By Nick Smith  <br><br>Thomas Croft was an organized man. That served him well during his time in the Union Navy during the Civil War. He was an officer, and he served as paymaster on board a Monitor-class ship in the fighting around Mobile Bay. This then-new class of ship, based on the famous Monitor, was an armored, turreted vessel designed for fighting fortifications and other ships. It was low to the water, hard to hit, and had a small number of very large cannons on board. In battle, part of Croft's assignment would have been to carry any messages from the captain to the gun crews. In those pre-electronic days, only a voice tube connected the captain's post to the gun turrets, and that was unreliable in combat. Unfortunately, in those pre-ear protection days, the men serving those enclosed guns often suffered varying amounts of hearing loss. This was true of Thomas Croft, who eventually lost much of his hearing.<br><br>A few years after the war, Croft became part of a business venture to buy land in California. His personality and paymaster experience left him as the one trusted to handle the money and the financial paperwork. The group wanted to buy enough land to create an agricultural community. Croft came west and began negotiations with Benjamin Wilson and John Griffin to buy enough land for their project, but the group didn't have quite enough money to make the purchase. So, Croft talked former Colonel Jabez Banbury into joining the group, as well as ex-Confederate Aurelius Hutton. Their extra money was enough to put the deal on track.<br><br>Because of the nature of real estate law, and the vague business arrangements involved, the entire piece of property was signed over to the individual making the deal, and the sellers left it up to Croft to straighten things out at the receiving end. Thus, for roughly a day, Thomas Croft owned all of what would become Pasadena.<br>Once the rest of the group came west, they divided up the land and laid out the first roads. Their meeting to divide the land was held on a rise just west of where Pasadena Museum of History stands today.<br><br>Croft chose a piece of land at what is now the corner of California and Orange Grove, and he is credited with being the first one in the colony to begin the process of planting. The group would soon plant many fruit trees and grapevines.<br><br>Within a year, Croft helped found the local Presbyterian church, becoming one of the trustees. Mrs. Croft apparently thought that their new home was a little drab, and she felt homesick. So, Croft planted a garden of roses, the flower for which Pasadena would soon become famous. His may have been the first such garden on south Orange Grove, a short walk from where the Tournament of Roses headquarters now stands.<br>He invested in various businesses, including the Pasadena Packing Company, which shipped fruit from this area to other parts of the country.<br><br>The rest of the Croft story isn't as happy. His hearing loss garbled the stories he told of his past, so that even the newspaper articles mentioning him had facts wrong. Some listed him as having served on the Monitor, rather than a Monitor-class ship, and lauded him for his battle experience, but listed him in the wrong battles.<br>Near the end of his life, Croft displayed signs of what might today be called a form of dementia, perhaps Alzheimer's. As a result, he was ordered to be housed at Patton Asylum in 1910, but he died at his home before he could be sent there.<br></li>

THOMAS FINLEY BARNES, of Los Angeles, is a native of the city of La Porte, Indiana, and is a son of Enos R. and Elizabeth A. (Croft) Barnes, the father a native of Painesville, Ohio, and a son of one of the pioneers of that town, and for many years postmaster of the first-named place.  He came to the Pacific Slope with his family in 1860, and located at Gold Hill, Nevada Territory, and there served as postmaster and agent for the Wells Fargo Express Company until his death in 1865.  The subject's widowed mother is now living with her eldest son, W. C. Barnes, of Holbrook, Arizona.  Of her two sons Thomas F. is the youngest.  He was born June 24, 1861.  He received a good common school education and learned the printer's trade in his native town, with the publishing house of Douglas & Carlan.  Mr. Barnes has previously made several trips to the Pacific Coast -- once around Cape Horn, twice across the Isthmus of Panama, and once overland.  He is a first class stage artist and excels in comedy plays.  He has traveled as a comedian throughout the entire Northwest and British Columbia with the Barton Hill Company, and as a delineator of comedy characters has won the highest approval of the press and the public.  He, however, abandoned the stage and came to Los Angeles in 1880, and occupied the position of assistant foreman in the printing house of the <i>Mirror</i> Company until 1885, when he entered the now well-established and esteemed business firm of Kingsley & Barnes, printers, No. 57 North Spring street.  Mr. Barnes married, in 1880, Miss Florence MacDonald, a daughter of William and Charlotte (Herriott) MacDonald, of San Francisco.  Mrs. Barnes is of English-Scotch parentage, and was born July 23, 1860.  She is a most estimable lady of culture, and has one daughter, Ethel, born August 27, 1882.<a href="e3084.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c12712.8">[<a href="s15.htm#s652">S652</a>]  <i>The Case Of Will C. Barnes's Missing Brother</i>, THE CASE OF WILL C. BARNES'S MISSING BROTHER.  A Historical Footnote.  Historians are well advised to question commonly held assumptions.  The editors of <i>The Journal of Arizona History</i> were recently reminded of this fact when we received a letter from David K. Martin of Phoenix.  Mr. Martin, a grandnephew of Will C. Barnes, noticed a misstatement in Kathleen L. Howard's article, "Benham, Barnes, Brizard and the Curio," in the spring 2001 issue of the journal.  "I thoroughly enjoyed the above named article by Ms Howard and was happy to find additional information on the life of my great uncle Will C. Barnes," he explained.  "'Uncle Will' became part of our family when he married Edith Talbot, my paternal grandmother Miriam Talbot's older sister, in 1897.  However the article did contain one error that should be noted.<br>"Will C. Barnes was not an only child as stated.  He had a younger brother, Thomas F.  There are at least two articles in early day newspapers (<i>Arizona Republican</i>, April 19, 1892, and the <i>Phoenix Herald</i>, April 30, 1897) that mention their relationship.  Such information can be further verified in the Probate Records of Storey County, Nevada, after the untimely, unexpected and, unfortunately, intestate death of his father September 23, 1863, on a business trip to San Francisco.  While I have not been able to look at the birth certificates for the Barnes boys, it seems to be an accepted fact that Will was born June 21, 1858 in San Francisco while Thomas, according to the federal census records I have reviewed, was born June 1860, in Indiana.  Probably in LaPorte where his grandparents Croft were living at the time.<br>"Perhaps I am making too much of Uncle Will being listed as an only child in the article but I still vividly remember the homework 8th grade assignment I had been given to write about someone who had lived in Arizona during the 'pioneer days.'  I chose to write about Uncle Will having been awarded the Medal of Honor and to spice the story up a bit I added that he had fought his way through hordes of Apaches while crossing the river.  When I showed my literary efforts to my father, he handed it back with the comments, 'David, part of this story isn't true.  When you write history, make sure all of it is true.  If they aren't you are writing fiction.'"<br>Mr. Martin's letter and kind offer to share the information he has gathered on the Barnes/Croft families opened a rewarding correspondence, at the same time that it sent us scurrying to the archives.  With Mr. Martin's help, we learned that Thomas Finley Barnes was born on June 24, 1860, in Indiana, and died on January 21, 1944, at age eight-three, in Los Angeles.  In 1888 he was a partner of Kingsley & Barnes, in 1900 he was an oil broker, and by 1920 he was a department manager in a paper-box factory.  Thomas Barnes married Florence Heriot McDonald and the couple has one child, Ethel Mary.  Phoenix newspapers noted Tom Barnes's presence at his brother's wedding to Edith Talbot in 1897 and listed him as a surviving relative when Will died in 1936.<br>The question next arose, "Why doesn't Will Barnes mention a brother in his autobiography, <i>Apaches & Longhornes</i>, published by the Ward Richie Press in 1941 and reprinted by the University of Arizona Press in 1982?"  The answer appears to lay in an unintentional oversight on the part of Frank C. Lockwood, who edited the autobiography for publication, and a lack of careful attention by subsequent historians.  In his introduction to the 1941 edition, Lockwood--an English professor at the University of Arizona--enthused that "I undertake the editing of this volume as a labor of love and, also, as a service to the State of Arizona, to which I acknowledge a deep devotion, as did also the writer of these memoirs."  He went on to explain how "during his later years Will Barnes spent much time in the preparation of his autobiography, writing down with racy and graphic detail the more exciting and worthwhile incidents of his remarkable life.  Indeed, the record was so full and extended that it has seemed to Mrs, Barnes and me that it would gain in unity and would appear to been advantage in book form if limited to an account of the author's Arizona experiences."  Lockwood, therefore, omitted the first 172 pages of the manuscript autobiography, in which Barnes describes his youth and young manhood, that includes references to his younger brother, Tom.  Lockwood mentions only that after the death of his father, Enos Rollin Barnes, in 1863, Will "and his widowed mother went to make their home at LaPorte, Indiana, with his grandfather Croft," leaving the reader to assume that Will was an only child.  In fact, Will and Tom lived with their mother in Indiana, and for awhile on their uncle's farm in Minnesota, until Tom struck out on his own in December of 1876.<br>Paul J. Scheips, in his brief biography,<i> Will Croft Barns: A Westerner of Parts</i> (Washington, D.C.: Potomac Corral of the Westerners, 1981), acknowledges the manuscript copy of Barnes's reminiscences in the Will C. Barnes Collection at the Arizona Historical Society and explains that "a comparison of Lockwood's published version ... with the original manuscript, made for the present author by Thomas C. Barnes, indicates a high degree of conformance between the two."  Scheips apparently refers only to the portions of the reminiscence that Lockwood actually used in <i>Apaches & Longhornes</i>,  In the same note, Scheips describes Thomas F. Barnes as "a brother with whom Will evidently did not get along."  Tom is not mentioned in the text, however.  In reprinting <i>Apaches & Longhornes</i>, the University of Arizona Pres replace Lockwood's introduction with Scheips's brief biography, but deleted Scheips's footnotes, again leaving the impression that Will Barnes was an only child.<br>Although we have no evidence that Tom and his older sibling "did not get along," it is easy to imagine how Tom faded into the shadow cast by his colorful and famous brother.  Mr. Martin acknowledges that even he might not have known about Uncle Tom if he had not met him at Will Barnes's funeral in 1936.  He also provides a priceless glimpse of his Uncle Will through a youngster's eyes.  "I was luckily seated next to Uncle Will at the family Sunday night dinners at my Grandmother Martin's home for the 4 years or so after Uncle Will retired in Washington, D.C. and they returned to make their home at Grandma's," he writes.  "I can't remember Uncle Will ever mentioning any member of his family.  In fact, I can't remember him ever talking about anything or anyone other than himself.  Most of that was about his life as a cattleman or his life in the army.  And what better conversation for a 5 to 8 year old boy than to listen about cowboys and Indians.  Although from time to time (when chopped spinach was on the dinner menu) he would suggest that he and I run away, with my parents' and his wife's's permission, naturally, and become cattlemen where we could have good things to eat like fried rattlesnake brains and calf eye balls and any part of a bear that we could bite off."  He sounds like the kind of great uncle any young boy would give his eyeteeth to have around.<br>Although we still know comparatively little about Tom Barnes, we can at least set the record straight and alert future historians that Will C. Barnes did indeed have a younger brother.  And, the editors of <i>The Journal of Arizona History</i> have had the pleasure of corresponding with David Martin, who takes history as seriously as we all should.  "If Will and John. </li>

<li id="c12713.5">[<a href="s15.htm#s640">S640</a>] Obituary for Will C. Barnes.  <i>Arizona Republic</i>, Page 1 and continued on page 12.  Will C. Barnes, Noted Arizona Pioneer, Dies.  Will C. Barnes, pioneer Arizona Indian fighter, cattle man, legislator and author, died unexpectedly in a local hospital last night, his death closing a colorful chapter in the state's history.  He was 78 years old.  Operated on Wednesday morning, he was believed well on his way to recovery when his condition took a sudden turn for the worse.  Was in Forest Service.  In addition to a wide Arizona and New Mexico acquaintance, Mr. Barnes was know throughout the United States forest service, for which he was assistant forester for 21 years, and in Washington, D.C., where he was for two years secretary of the United States Geographic Board in addition to his other federal service.  In 1881 he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor "for bravery in action against hostile Apache Indians" at Fort Apache.  Born in San Francisco.  Will Croft Barnes was born in San Francisco June 21, 1858, spending his youth and young manhood in California, Ohio, Nevada, Indiana and Minnesota.  He received his early education in the public schools of Minneapolis, Minn., and La Porte, Ind.  As a young man he studied piano and voice under masters.  Mr. Barnes' father was a representative in Nevada's first legislature.  At 16, Mr. Barnes went to San Francisco and was employed in a large music house.  Was Military Telegrapher.  In 1880 he was appointed United States military telegrapher at Fort Apache.  To use Mr. Barnes' own words:  "When I came to Arizona the Southern Pacific only had advanced to Maricopa Wells and passenger service ended at Yuma.  We crossed the desert by stage to Tucson.  The Indians were bad and travel wasn't healthy x x x"  Mr. Barnes narrowly missed taking a stage, passengers of which were killed by Indians, at one phase of his journey.  Read Own Obituary.  In the Cibeque outbreak of August, 1880, a band of White River Apaches who for several days had besieged the Fort Apache garrison, boasted they had burned the post to the ground and killed everyone in it.  Until reinforcements could reach the post and word could be sent back that the garrison was safe, the tale was believed.  And Barnes later read his own obituary in the New York newspaper.  Barnes served both as a private and sergeant in the army signal corps.  Turned Down Lieutenancy.  On leaving the army service in 1882 he went into the cattle business in the Holbrook country, turning down an offer of a commission as second lieutenant.  He became general manager and principal owner of the Esperanza Cattle Company, one of the largest cattle concerns of Apache county.  "As an officer and active member of the Stock Men's Protective Association of Apache County he did much towards breaking up one of the worst gangs of cattle thieves and murderers that every infested Arizona," said an 1895 biographer.  In 1890 he was elected to the Apache County Board of Supervisors, the following year entering the territorial legislature as a representative from Apache county.  Moved To New Mexico.  He was appointed member of the Arizona commission to the World's Fair in Chicago in 1892.  For the years 1897 and 1900, inclusive, he served as chairman of the Arizona Live Stock Board.  Moving to New Mexico after relinquishing most of his Northern Arizona cattle interests, Mr. Barnes was a member of the New Mexico legislature from Colfax county in 1901 and 1902, being appointed in the latter year chairman of the New Mexico Live Stock Board, a post he held for four years.  In 1907 he began his 21-year service in the forest service, during most of this period acting as director of grazing.  Having been in the open range cattle business many years and closely familiar with the cattle man's problems, he won honors in his federal post and was given many responsible commissions by the forest service.  Retiring from the forest service in 1928, Mr. Barnes was out of the public service only a short time when he returned to it, this time in the capacity of secretary of the United States Geographic Board.  In this capacity he was credited with clarifying many confused situations in regard to place names all over the country.  He was author of "Western Grazing Grounds and Forest Ranges," "Tales From the X-Bar Horse Camp," "Cattle" (with William MacLeod Raine) and "Arizona Place Names."  Returning to his favorite Arizona in 1930 after quitting his post with the geographic board, Mr. Barnes completed "Arizona Place Names" and then took a trip around the world, which gave him further material for his literary works.  Wrote Many Articles.  In addition to his books, he was the author of many hundreds of articles published in magazines and newspapers.  He was an enthusiast regarding the annual Arizona Pioneers Reunions conducted by the Arizona Republic and delighted in mingling with Arizona's old-timers.  He married in Phoenix in 1897 to Edith Talbot.  A member of the Hiram Club here, Mr. Barnes also was a member of the Arts Club in Washington, serving as president of the latter organization in 1929.  He also was a member of National lodge No. 6, Free and Accepted Masons, Washington, D.C.  Will Be Cremated.  He was a member of the vestry of Trinity cathedral.  He lived at 808 North Second avenue here.  Surviving are, besides his wife, one brother, Thomas F., Los Angeles.
