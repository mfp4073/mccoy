<li id="c1242.17">[<a href="s2.htm#s565">S565</a>] Source not known, There exists a large amount of information concerning William H. Gilbert's application for a pension from Civil War service.  Important dates: Enlisted, Sept 5, 1864; Mustered, Sept 30, 1864, Discharged Sept 1, 1865; Declaration Filed April 29, 1889.  On the "Original Invalid Claim - Basis of Claim, filed 29 Apr 1889 we read: "That in the line of duty in Henry Co., Ky. about Nov 1, 1864 he contracted measles and went to field hospital, stayed five days.  Was then ordered to leave with Regiment and had to march 22 miles during a rain while the measles were out on me getting wet and being obliged to lay out the next night with my wet clothes on.  Was then put in a box car and shipped 150 miles being in the car 23 hours.  From the car was taken to General hospital where I remained 15 days, was then sent to camp and stayed eight days and was there prostrated with intermittent fever and was taken back to general hospital where I staid." <br> The following story comes from Horace Gilbert, 1 Nov 1989. "My grandfather was one of those who came down with the measles followed by pneumonia. As the number of men afflicted became a major problem, it was decided to send the serious cases to a hospital somewhere in Northern Kentucky. My grandfather was one of about 50 men who were placed aboard a box car without heat or nursing care of any kind and sent north.  After some time, probably a matter of days, the box car arrived at the hospital location.  When it was opened, my grandfather was the only soldier still alive. After a long convalescence, he was sent home for the remainder of the war.  It is said that he was never as strong again as he was before this illness. Returning to his home in Northern Kentucky (near Mount Olivet) he fell in love and married the "belle" of the area, Lucy Meyers Collins, July 23, 1865.  It is said he had the 'territory' to all himself during this period as all of the other young men were away fighting the Civil War."</li>

<li id="c1242.24">[<a href="s6.htm#s239">S239</a>] Obituary of William H. Gilbert.  <i>The Prairie City News</i>, We publish this week some additional obituary notes concerning the late W. H. Gilbert, which we were unable to obtain last week.    William Harrison Gilbert was born in Kentucky, Oct 28, 1843 and died Nov. 11, 1903, at the age of 60 years and 14 days.  He was married to Miss Lucy Collins in 1865 and to them were born six children, Wm., George, Kramer, Eva, Fred and Raleigh, all of whom survive except Fred, who died several years ago.  Mr. Gilbert was a Union Army veteran, having served his country for a period of over three years, being one of the stalwart defenders of the Union in the state of Kentucky, when it meant something to be a Union sympathizer.  The surviving children were all present at the funeral except Will, who is in California, and to those stalwart sons and loving daughter, the widowed mother will now look for sympathy and faithful care during her declining years.  The funeral sermon was preached by Rev. Proctor at the M. E. church of which Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert have been faithful and consistent members for many years.  The sermon was an appropriate tribute to a faithful soldier, a loving husband and father, and a citizen of sterling character.  Frank Gilbert and wife of Des Moines and Robert Gilbert of Audubon Co., were present at the funeral, besides the relatives here at home.<a href="e1936.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Collins was born in Owensville, Bath Country, Kentucky, March 2, 1841, and died at her home in San Mateo, California, August 18, 1921, aged eighty years, five months and sixteen days.    She was married to William Harrison Gilbert in 1865.  To this union nine children were born, three of whom died in infancy, and one son was drowned in 1895.  Five children survive, as follows:  W. B. Gilbert, of San Francisco, California; G. W. Gilbert, of Rockford, Illinois; Mrs. Eva McCoy, of Prairie City, Iowa; Dr. Kramer Gilbert of Chandler, Arizona; and J. R. Gilbert, of San Mateo, California.  There are also eleven grand children and two great grandchildren, and one sister, Mrs. Caroline Brammer, of Ames, Iowa.    The surviving children were all present at her funeral with the exception of William and Kramer.    Mrs. Gilbert was an active and devoted member of the Methodist Episcopal church for about fifty years.  In a letter written August 4th, just two weeks before she passed away, she wrote:  I have a hope that reaches beyond the grave.  I know that I cannot stay here much longer, but it means everything to be ready when Jesus says:  "It is enough, come up higher!"    Funeral services were held from the Methodist church by the pastor, Rev. D. J. McKay, and the remains were laid to rest in Westview cemetery.    The following relatives and friends from out of town were present in addition to the immediate family:  Mrs. Caroline Brammer, sister, Ames, Iowa; Mrs. Ben Edwards, Ames, Iowa; Mrs. Amy Weaver, Coon Rapids, Iowa;  Mr. and Mrs. Herman Wiggins, of Des Moines, Iowa; Mr. and Mrs. Frank Anderson, of Des Moines, Iowa; Alta Gilbert, of Des Moines, Iowa; Mr. and Mrs. Berry Taylor, of Newton, Iowa; Edna Gillespie, of Des Moines, Iowa; Mr. and Mrs. Lyman Weaver, of Newton, Iowa; Mrs. Jake Brunner, of Newton, Iowa; Mrs. Kate Lust and daughter La Fountain, of Iowa City, Iowa; Mrs. Lucy Remsburg, of Colfax, Iowa; and Lulu I. Kellogg, of Des Moines, Iowa.    CARD OF THANKS    We take this means to express our gratitude to friends and neighbors for their many acts of kindness and words of comfort in our bereavement. G. W.

Each week the Arizonan selects a citizen of this community whose friendly manner and neighborly attitude has earned such recognition.  <br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Dr. Kramer M. Gilbert walks or drives about on the streets of Chandler today, he can't help from comparing the present bustling city to the few scattered buildings which he found here 42 years ago when he first sighted the newly-formed village of Chandler.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chandler was only a few months old when Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert and their baby son arrived on Jan. 17, 1913, from a small town in Iowa.  Weariness from traveling played a major part in their decision to settle in Chandler.  The many hundreds of friends and patients of the doctor will always be thankful it was here where he decided to end his westward journey and put out his shingle as a doctor of medicine.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Gilbert first started practicing medicine in Curlew, Palo Alto county, Ia.  In June, 1909 he had married Bessie Sanders of Carlisle, Ia., whom he had met during his college days, and the young couple started housekeeping at Curlew.  But the west called and a pioneering spirit made them decide to seek their fortune in California.  Late in 1912, the young couple with their year and a half old son, Horace, started out by car to drive to the coast.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over dirt roads, through rain and snow, they drove in their Case touring car with many breakdowns to the car, being mired in mud and seeking unmarked roadways hindering their trip.  When they finally reached Arizona the were marooned for one whole week in Springerville by heavy snows.  After six weeks on the road they drove into Phoenix and Dr. Gilbert said, "It looked like fairyland to us."  Too tired to go on, they decided to rest a while in the warmth and sunshine of that city of 22,000 people.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In driving about the countryside, Dr. Gilbert stopped in Mesa one day and a chance acquaintance, upon finding that he was a doctor, told him of the new town of Chandler which badly needed a doctor.  Upon investigating, the tiny village surrounded by many vast ranches, looked to be a likely spot for a young doctor and from that time, all thoughts of going to California were forgotten.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There were two general stores, a blacksmith shop, two frame houses and one in the process of being built, and the San Marcos hotel under construction on that day in January 1913 when the little family arrived bag and baggage.  Dr. Gilbert made arrangements to buy the house which was being built and which he was told would be completed in a short time, but it was several weeks before that fact was accomplished and in the meanwhile they lived in a tent on their newly acquired property.  The home they bought and watched being built is the same one they are living in today at 141 North Colorado street.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Approximately 100 people made up the population of Chandler, and the majority of them were workers on the San Marcos hotel, who with their families, were living in tents and other temporary structures.  The first floor of the hotel had been completed at that time but by November of 1913 the main building had been finished and a grand opening was held bringing many visitors.  From then on, the village began to rapidly grow and seven years later, it boasted a population of about 1,000 people.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the first structures to be built in the new town was the schoolhouse, a small building of three units, on the same ground where the Cleveland school is today.  It was here the first church services were held in Chandler.  A group of the workmen from the San Marcos hotel had a box supper and raised $100 which they promised to the first church founded in the new town.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A month after his arrival, Dr. Gilbert enlisted the aid of a few others and through his efforts lumber was bought and a building 26 by 40 feet was erected on a lot donated by Dr. A. J. Chandler.  The church was called the Community Methodist church but was opened to all denominations until the time when members would seek their own places of worship.  Dr. Gilbert said it wasn't long before other churches sprang up in the community.  That original little building is today a part of the Methodist church.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Gilbert is a charter member of the Methodist church and was the first member of the first board of trustees.  He has been instrumental in the growth of the church and a guiding light for all of its activities these many years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Gilbert was a busy man in those early years watching after the health of the growing population and making calls at all hours of the day or night to ranches and homes far out on the desert.  But the years ahead became even busier ones as the village grew to be a town and two world wars brought extra long hours to those in the medical profession.  Dr. Gilbert's first office was in a little building on Commonwealth, the property recently sold to the Valley National Bank.  In 1915 he moved to a San Marcos Place location, which today is occupied by Williams Stationery.  In 1919, the doctor bought property on West Boston street and set up his office in a part of the building where he remained for the next 27 years.  That former office is now the site of the Boston Shoe Repair shop.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During World War II, there was one year when Dr. Gilbert was the only doctor in Chandler.  After those strenuous times and with the return of more doctors to the community, he decided to relinquish as much of his practice as he could, and in 1946 semi-retired and has been taking life at a little more leisurely pace since then.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He recalls that during his years of practice he has brought approximately 2,500 babies into the world.  And he says at least 2,000 of these were home confinements.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Always deeply interested in civic affairs of the community, Dr. Gilbert was an active member of the Chamber of Commerce, an organization that has been a part of the community since its earliest days.  He served on the Board of Directors for many years and was president during the year 1940.  This is the year, he proudly stated, that Chandler showed its greatest surge in population and prosperity.  It was that year that the Williams Air Force Base was brought to the Chandler vicinity principally through the inducement of the Chamber of Commerce.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Gilbert says that in his opinion Chandler's growth depended upon two major facts.  In 1916 Dr. A. J. Chandler sold 8,000 acres of his land to the Goodyear Rubber Co., and from 1912, the year the town was founded, up until 1920 the population increased from 100 to 1,000 souls.  From then until 1940 the town was more or less at a standstill with only 1,300 population, but with the coming of WAFB and the influx of newcomers following World War II, the growth has been rapid and the census of 1950 showed more than 4,000 population.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first fraternal organization in Chandler was the Knights of Pythias and for many years it was an active and prominent lodge in the town.  Dr. Gilbert was its first vice chancellor and was later chancellor.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kramer M. Gilbert was born on Jan. 30, 1882, at Prairie City, Ia., to William Harrison Gilbert and Lucy Myers Collins Gilbert.  In 1900 his parents moved to Des Moines, the capital city of the state, and it was there he attended Drake academy and later took his pre-medical and medical course at Drake University, graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1908.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is a member of the Maricopa County, Arizona State and the American Medical Associations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert's only child, Horace Gilbert, graduated from the Chandler high school and Arizona State College in Tempe with the class of 1933.  He taught in the Chandler schools for three years and then went to the University of Chicago where he received his master's degree.  At present he is living in Des Moines where he is educational consultant for the Encyclopedia Britannica.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Gilberts make a trip back to Iowa at least once a year, sometimes in the spring and occasionally in the fall when Dr. Gilbert attends homecoming at Drake University.  They have an added reason for being anxious to make the visit to Iowa, because Dr. Gilbert says there is the most wonderful thing in the world back there in Des Moines, their 20-month granddaughter Marilyn Elizabeth.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his early days in Chandler Dr. Gilbert played a lot of golf and admitted he was pretty good at the game, but with the stress of business and long hours, he had to give up the pastime.  He likes to fish and was able to get in some salmon fishing last year.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About 11 years ago he bought 40 acres of land at Chandler Heights and devotes most of his time in the interests of citrus farming.  He has 22 acres planted to orange and grapefruit groves.  He is president of the Chandler Heights Citrus Growers and is a member of the board of the Arizona Sunkist Citrus Growers.</li>

Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert Celebrate Fiftieth Wedding Anniversary.  Dr. and Mrs. Kramer M. Gilbert have returned to their Chandler home after a visit with their son and family, Horace Gilbert, at La Habra, Calif.<br> While in La Habra, the highlight of their visit was the courtesy extended to them by their son in honor of their golden wedding anniversary.  The anniversary, which fell on June 16, was celebrated on Father's Day, Sunday, June 14.  Among the guests at the reception honoring Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert was Mrs. John Slocum who had been a guest at their wedding fifty years ago.<br> Dr. Gilbert and the former Bessie Sanders, who was a teacher in the Des Moines, Iowa schools, were married in 1909 at Carlisle, Iowa.  Dr. Gilbert was practicing medicine in Iowa at the time.  It was the fall following Arizona's admission to statehood when he and Mrs. Gilbert came to Arizona.  The following January, 1913, they moved to Chandler and have made this their home since that time.<br> Both of them have been prominently identified with the growth of the social and civic life of Chandler.  They are charter members of the Community Methodist Church and continue their interest and work in the church.  The leading physician in the Chandler area for many years, Dr. Gilbert retired from active practice only a few years ago.  Their attractive home on North Colorado street abounds in stately olive, citrus and other trees which the Gilberts set out many years ago.  Dr. Gilbert was one of the original developers of the citrus groves at Chandler Heights.<br> The majority of their fifty years of married life has been spent in Chandler and on the occasion of their anniversary, the Gilberts said the years here have been happy ones.</li>
<li id="c1247.14">[<a href="s7.htm#s1">S1</a>] Obituary of Dr. Gilbert.  Chandler's First Doctor and Pioneer Citizen Dies Sunday.  Scores of persons paid their final respects this week to Dr. Kramer Martin Gilbert whose death Sunday, March 6, at the Mesa Southside Hospital, saddened the community in which he had lived since 1913 and had served as its first doctor and its only doctor for many years.  Final rites were observed for the 78-year-old physician yesterday (Wednesday) morning at the Chapel of the Bueler Mortuary with the Rev. William Kendall of the Community Methodist Church officiating.  Burial was in Mesa City Cemetery.  Serving as pall bearers were Stanley Know, Leonard Edwards, Elmer Woeller, J. H. Sossaman, Peter Donhough, James David and Barney Appleby.  Since his semiretirement in 1946 from his medical practice, Dr. Gilbert had remained active in church work and other civic enterprises.  During the autumn of last year he was a familiar sight almost daily as he supervised remodeling and modernizing of his business property on West Boston Street.  A fall in the latter part of 1959 hospitalized the doctor and he was confined to his home for several weeks.  He apparently recovered from the injury but was weakened again when he suffered an attack of flu.  He was taken to the hospital last week following a heart attack and died Sunday.  Dr. Gilbert was born January 30, 1882, at Prairie City, Iowa.  He graduated from Drake University Medical School at Des Moines in 1903 and began his practice in Curlew, Iowa, where he lived for three years before coming to Arizona.  Imbued with a pioneering spirit, Dr. Gilbert left Iowa late in 1912 with his wife and small son and headed west to establish his practice.  When the family arrived in Phoenix after a long and arduous trip in an open touring car, through rain and snow and over dirt roads, the valley looked like "fairyland" to them and they decided to rest in the warmth and sunshine.  During those weeks Dr. Gilbert drove about the countryside and learned of the newly founded village of Chandler which badly needed a doctor.  On January 17, 1913, the Gilbert family moved to Chandler and lived in a tent for several weeks before a house on their newly acquired property was completed.  It was the third house built in Chandler, located at 141 North Colorado Street and remained Dr. Gilbert's home for the rest of his life.  Dr. Gilbert was the only doctor here for many years and led a busy life taking care of the health of the growing community and making calls at all hours of the day and night to ranches and homes far out on the desert.  He was instrumental in building the first church in Chandler, a few months after his arrival, and was a charter member of the Community Methodist Church.  Until his death, he took an active part in church activities.  His civic interests were wide and varied.  He was the first vice chancellor and later chancellor of the Knights of Pythias, the first fraternal lodge in Chandler.  He was a past president of the Chamber of Commerce, a past president of the Chandler Heights Citrus Growers Association and was affiliated with the Maricopa County, Arizona and American Medical Associations.  A devotee of sports of all kinds, especially football, Dr. Gilbert was a charter member of the Sun Angels.  Last June, Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.  Those fifty years of love and devotion have been a symbol of true marriage to their many friends.  Survivors include his wife Bessie; a son, Horace, and a granddaughter, Marilyn Elizabeth of La Habra, Calif.; and a brother, J. R.

Duffy to  <i>Ethel Benham</i> dated 26 February 1979, In 1946 shortly after Bay and I were married, Dr. Kramer Gilbert came to Mallard to visit our local doctor who was a classmate at Drake.  It was Doctor Keeney and his wife who had introduced Dr. Kramer to the woman whom he married.  Dr. Kenney invited me over to meed them.  Dr. Kramer's head, forehead and hair line was so much like my Dad's that I commented that it must be a Gilbert trait.  I am enclosing a copy of a clipping from the Des Moines Tribune at the time of Dr. Kramer Gilbert's death.  Perhaps you already have it, but if not you can add it to your papers.<a href="e4187.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
