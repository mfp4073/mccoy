Of interest to valley residents is the marriage of Miss Ethel Maxine McCoy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. McCoy of Chandler, and James Edward Benham of Williams, the rites having been performed yesterday morning in the Federated church in Flagstaff.  After a wedding trip to Oak Creek canyon, the couple will go to Camp Verde, where Mr. Benham will teach school, to establish their home.  (Caption under photo of bride).<br><br>Chandler Girl Becomes Bride,  Flagstaff Aug. 14&#8211;Miss Ethel Maxine McCoy, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. McCoy of Chandler, became the bride of James Edward Benham, son of Mr. and Mrs. Henry L. Benham of Williams, in a ceremony performed early this morning in the Federated church here.  The rites were read by the Rev. Ray W. Ragsdale before an alter banked with potted plants, fern and wild summer flowers.  The bride was given in marriage by her uncle, Dr. Kramer M. Gilbert of Chandler and her sister, Miss Enid McCoy, who came from her home in Los Angeles for the ceremony, was her maid of honor.  Henry Benham of Winslow, brother of the bridegroom, was the best man.  The bride wore a white satin princess gown made with cowl neckline and a redingote of satin and lace.  The redingote was fashioned with Elizabethan collar, long, tight-fitting lace sleeves and a long train.  She wore a Juliet cap trimmed with seed pearls and a full-length circular face veil of tulle edged with lace.  Her flowers were white gladioli and ferns.  The maid of honor wore a canary yellow silk lace frock over a taffeta slip.  She carried a shower bouquet of blue delphinium.  Bridesmaids were Miss Guinola Robinson of Coolidge, who wore pink lace over taffeta, Miss Dorothy Fain of Williams, who wore blue eyelet embroidery, Miss Dorothy Parkhurst of Chandler, wearing orchid net over satin, and Miss Elizabeth Gholson of Chandler in silver green organza over taffeta.  Each carried French boutonniere hand bouquets of varicolored sweet peas.  Ushers were William Armstrong of Yuma, Rannel Jones of Hope, N.M., Clifford Armack and Tom Rittenhouse, both of Williams.  Mrs. Eldon A. Ardrey, organist, played "The Bridal Chorus" from "Lohengrin" as the processional and Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" as the recessional.  During the ceremony she played "I Love You Truly" softly.  Miss Elizabeth Phelps of Mesa sang Cadman's "At Dawning".  Following the ceremony, a wedding breakfast was served at Hotel Monte Vista to members of the bridal party and the families of the couple.  The pair left for a 10-day wedding trip to Oak Creek Canyon.  The newlyweds will establish their home in Camp Verde, where Mr. Benham is teacher of science, mathematics and music in the Camp Verde high school.  The wedding was the culmination of a romance which began when the bride and bridegroom were students at Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff.  The bride, a graduate of Chandler high school, will be graduated from the Flagstaff college next June.  Mr. Benham received his education at Williams and during his junior year of high school attended the New Mexico Military Institute at Roswell.  He is a graduate of the teachers college and taught in Flagstaff last year.<a href="e1005.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c1209.9">[<a href="s5.htm#s673">S673</a>] The "Drunk Doctor" of Prairie City, Iowa, Various stories have filtered down through the years regarding this drunken doctor of Prairie City, Iowa.   Recalling the stories Mother told to me, and the ones Ethel remembers, I would like to write up these tidbits of colorful information for those who have an interest.<br><br>I first remember hearing about, this "doctor," is when at an early age, I would ask my Mother why Grandfather was now a farmer, rather than the pharmacist he had trained to be, and once was.  Mother said, "There was, in that day, only one doctor in town, and he had a bad drinking problem."  Ethel remembers his name was Dr. Harp.  Mother told me, when Grandfather McCoy was a pharmacist, he would receive a prescription from a patient of his, then his problems would begin.  He would have to second guess the doctor.  Was this the correct medication for the patient or was the doctor drunk when he wrote it.  Then if he didn't fill the prescription as the doctor wrote it, would feel the repercussions.  If he filled the prescription of a drunken doctor, then he might cause injury to the patient. Mother tells that Grandfather would lay awake at night and worry if he had given the right prescription to that person, or had he given them something that could cause them harm.  The pressure became too great, and he decided to give up pharmacy.  Ethel remembers that her father was also sickly around this time, and it was suggested that he might be more suited to an outdoors job, like farming.  Eva's parents William Harrison Gilbert and his wife Lucy Collins Gilbert, were getting up in years, and William had not been well since he contracted measles during the Civil War.  The family farm needed someone to run it.  Charles McCoy took the job.  His wife, Rose Evelyn (Eva) Gilbert McCoy was heard, years later saying, "If I had known he was going to be a farmer, I never would have married him."<br><br>Next Mother told me about her birth.  She said that Grandmother McCoy's first labor had been long and difficult, so difficult, that the doctor told her she would never live through the birth of another baby.  Mother being the second, was an unwelcome omen to come.  When it did finely come time for Mother to be born, all arrangements had been made for Grandmother's death. Someone had been chosen to care for Aunt Helen, I'm sure a relative.  Funeral arrangements had been made, etc.  Of course no name had been chosen, no diapers prepared, or baby clothes arranged.  So to everyone's surprise, when Mother was born alive, and Grandmother also lived through the ordeal, plans had to changed.  Just to think, after Helen, who was to be her last, she went on to have Ada, Enid, Gordon, Ethel and Harry.  Drunk doctor or not, she sure went on to fool him, and I guess everyone else.  This may have been reason enough for Grandmother to never believe a thing he said again.<br> <br>Aunt Ethel remembers being told about her birth.  Apparently Grandmother made it very clear to everyone, except the "drunk doctor," that he was to have nothing to do with her giving birth.  Grandmother had made arrangement for the mid-wife to deliver this baby.  Stern directives were given that the "drunk doctor" was not to come near her.  While the mid-wife was upstairs, the "drunk doctor" arrived at their home, and made his way into the kitchen, and indeed he was very drunk.  Grandfather was well entertained in the kitchen, not boiling water like he should have been doing. No!  He was in the kitchen preventing the "drunk doctor" from going upstairs and interfering with the work of the mid-wife.  Apparently all is well that ends well, Ethel is here to retell the story.  This is not where the story ends.  Ethel's birth was not recorded at that time.  When Ethel entered college she needed her birth certificate, but didn't have one.  I guess the "drunk doctor" was also spiteful.  We do know there was bad blood between the McCoy's and the Harp's.  Grandmother's brother, then a doctor, came to the rescue, and signed the papers to verify the fact that Ethel had indeed been born, on the date stated to the parents stated.<br>We have all heard of the terrible flu of 1919.  The McCoy family was not spared.  The flu hit Prairie City, and hit it hard.  The "drunk doctor," had lots to do besides drink.  He had the town's people, and the farm families to look after.  I'm sure Grandmother did not invite the "drunk doctor" to come by and treat the family.  Drunk or not he was a conscientious doctor, or needed more money for booze.  Mother tells how he rode up in his horse and carriage to stop in and tend to the needs of the McCoy family.  When he arrived he found most of the family members down with the flu, but not Grandfather.  He, of course, brought along his tonic that would cure anything, but Grandmother would have nothing to do with it.  She would treat her family with Welch's grape juice.  The "drunk doctor," said he would stop by next week and see how many had died.  When he arrived a week later, there was no grape juice in the house, but due in part to Welch's, no one had died.  Now may the good "drunk doctor" of Prairie City, Iowa rest in peace. <br><br>By:  Evelyn Manley; Granddaughter of Charles Brewin McCoy and Rose Evelyn Gilbert.  Daughter of Ada McCoy Sanders.
