[The following article was written and handed to us by the late Father Kellogg a few days before his death.]<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Rev. Albert E. Hastings, pastor of the Union Presbyterian church in Detroit, died on the 26th ult.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hastings belonged to a remarkable family, who history is worthy of record and remembrance, as illustrating in a very impressive manner the grace of God in the fulfillment of covenant promises.  A little before the commencement of the present century, Dr. Seth Hastings, Sen., removed from Washington, Litchfield Co., Conn., with his wife and seven children, six sons and one daughter, to Clinton, Oneida Co., N.Y.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The parents were neither poor nor rich in this world's goods, but they were rich in faith, and to an uncommon degree exemplified the faith of the gospel.  They supported and educated these children from the avails of a small farm and a limited professional practice.  Believing in the covenant, like Abraham, they "commended their children and household after them to keep the way of the Lord," expecting that God would bring upon them, that which he had promised.  As a family, they were singularly free from conformity to the world.  The children were frequently subject to the ridicule and derision of some of their companions, "certain lewd fellows of the baser sort," because of their abstinence from those follies and merry-making which were common at that time.  Those who derided them have long since, without an exception, passed into oblivion, while those who were the objects of their banter have become historic characters.<a href="e3132.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c10245.3">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 15.  A Missionary Hero.  By Samuel G. Arnold.  A few days ago King Kalakana, of Sandwich Islands, passed through Washington in his journey of circumvolution around the world, and paused a day to make his bow to the newly-inaugurated President and tender his good wishes.  He is the sovereign of a Christian Kingdom redeemed from heathenism through this missionary spirit; and, in his long journey his chamberlain and man of business was Col. Charles Judd, a native of the Islands, and the son of Dr. Garrett P. Judd, a Christian missionary, whose record is among the noblest in the annals of modern history.  He was for many years the right hand of the forming civilization represented by this royal personage. He and his helpful and efficient wife died not far asunder at their post of duty in the islands where all their children were born and still remain.  The story of his call the writer had from his mother many years ago, and it is worth repeating as illustrating what a masterly influence this missionary spirit is when it possesses a man in earnest.<br> Dr. Judd was a young man of twenty-five years, and had just entered into business at Paris Hill, N.Y. (near Utica), where his family resided, when he offered his services to the church in any field of duty where they might be required.  He had received his inspiration some time before through intercourse with a naval chaplain who had just visited the Pacific islands, and had seen what an opportunity was opening for their redemption.  Young Judd was not a minister, and not demonstrative in his religious character. His family were Presbyterians, who traced their lineage back to the landing of the Pilgrims, and had been religious for many generations.  He walked in their footsteps, but he was not a fanatic, not even an enthusiast, and not prone to sudden impulses.  He was not what people call a brilliant and promising man.  But he had good abilities, a fair education, and his family was remarkable for a certain steadiness of purpose which inclined them "to fight it out on this line."  Hence, when he began to talk about entering the missionary field, his friends all understood that he meant "business," and they advised him to go to Boston and consult the officers of the missionary board as to the proper thing for him to do.<br> He accordingly went, and took with him such letters and credentials as assured him a warm reception.  On one point he was made easy at once; a physician was a standing want at nearly all the missionary stations, and he was almost assured that he could choose the place where he would prefer to labor.  The mission at the Sandwich Islands had been opened five or six years before, and an expedition was then fitting out to strengthen it.  This point was, therefore, suggest to him, and he was informed that there was great need of a physician there.  Those islands were then 20,000 miles away, and the only mode of reaching them was by a small sailing vessel around the stormy Horn through an endless succession of calms and storms, and the great discomforts of a six month's voyage.  But the suggestion was no sooner thrown out than his mind leaped to the instant conclusion that, as here was the place of greatest need, here he would go; and he would be ready to sail with the outgoing expedition.  He, accordingly, gathered up his things, shook hands with his reverend friends and was about to leave when one of them asked him an interesting question.  Was he married?  He said he was not.  Was he under any engagements which he could bring to an immediate conclusion?  Again he said he was not.  It was then explained to him that this mission was very far away and among barbarians; that his social circle would be exceedingly narrow; that a home would be his first and great want, and that he should not think of going without a wife; and a wife who could assist him in his labors and cheer his days of heaviness and discouragement.<br> For the first time, since his resolution was taken he was deeply embarrassed and he left altogether unsettled as to the future.  First, he could not think where the lady lived who could meet such a demand; and, second, if found he did not see how she was to be obtained.  But on his way home he came to a pretty clear conviction of what he should attempt to do.  At Clinton, a few miles from Paris Hill, was a young lady of twenty-three or twenty-four years, whom he had often met and admired, who was gentle and pious, and, as a teacher, had shown decision of character and ability which had attracted so much attention as to make her the subject of general remark.  And he came to the conclusion that he would rest his case on her.<br> On reaching home and telling his story he found, to his great delight, that his judgment was approved by his family who warmly sympathized with his situation.  His Uncle Hastings (Mrs. Judd's brother) was among those who were consulted, and volunteered to ride over to Clinton and sound the young lady, Miss Laura Fish, in his behalf.  He went accordingly, was cordially greeted, and when they were seated in the parlor, and were alone, he began by speaking of the interest which had been awakened in the neighborhood on the subject of missions; and when he thought the proper opportunity arose he asked if she had not sometimes thought that she had a duty to perform in that respect.  She said in reply that she had often thought of the matter, but as no way was opened to her she had not been called on to make up her mind decisively.  Mr. Hastings then intimated to her that there was, he believed, a want, just now, for a person of her qualifications, to go out with the expedition which was about to sail for the Sandwich Islands, and put it to her whether she would go if there was a call for her from the American Board.  She said, after some hesitation, that she thought she would.  This was about as far as he had proposed to go, and he seemed to have nothing further to do than to take his leave.  But the occasion demanded expedition and something whispered to him that this was his opportunity; so, taking her hand, he looked up expressively into her eyes and said, "Will you go as the wife of Dr. Garrett P. Judd?"  She hesitated a moment, and there were conflicting emotions with blushes and tears, but after a while she recovered herself and said firmly, "Yes, I will."<br> They met at once and were married with small ceremony.  A few days were spent pleasantly in recurring the congratulations of friends, and then they bade farewell, with many tears, to the delightful household circle and left for Boston, expecting never to return.  After a long and wearisome passage of six months, including much sea-sickness and many discomforts, they landed at Honolulu, then a clump of brown huts, and were welcomed by the missionaries already there and a great crowd of natives, which Mrs. Judd describes as a motley crew, some of whom were partly clad in native cloth, made of bark pounded into a pulp and then spread out carefully and dried in the sun, but the greater part were entirely naked.<br> This was in 1828; fifty-three years ago.  Since then what a change!  A language formulated and printed; schools and churches erected; an active commercial post established; a whole people clothed and educated; a civilized government organized with its legislature, its courts of law, its system of revenue, its executive head and its large and growing commerce, and, finally, a Christian nation, added to the family of states.  Surely, here is something to show for the missionary spirit of our fathers!  Let the sons gird on their armor for still greater conquests!  "The field is the world," and the same inspiring voice is sounding in our ears and saying to us as it said to them:  "Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world!"<a href="e3131.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c10245.4">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 98-99.  Dr. Gerrit Parmele Judd, eldest son of Dr. Elnathan and Betsey Hastings, graduated at Hamilton College, and studied medicine, practicing for two or three years at Paris Hill.  He married Laura Fish, a teacher in the Clinton Female Seminary, and they sailed, on October 15, 1827, as missionaries to the Hawaiian Islands.  After some years' residence in the islands, Dr. Judd was called into the service of the Government, and filled with credit both the position of Secretary of State and Minister of Finance.  At the urgent request of the king, Dr. Judd accepted the appointment of minister plenipotentiary to the respective governments of the United States, of France, and of England.  He was accompanied by the two princes of the royal family, and was cordially received by the different governments to which he was accredited.  Before his return to the islands he revisited his old home, and the many friends and relatives residing in Clinton, and then he spent some time with his more immediate family, who had several years before removed to Troy, Mich.  While there he made arrangements for his mother and sister Harriet to make their home with him in Honolulu, and this plan was carried out the following year.  In a book, "Sketches of Life: Social, Political, and Religious, in Hawaii," written by Mrs. Laura Fish Judd, and published in 1880, a most interesting account if given of Dr. Judd's work in the islands.</li>

It was the privilege of the writer to be at the bedside of Laura Dickson, when "the silver cord was broken" and that strong, noble, true Christian soul passed into the "unseen holy."  Like the mountain-side whereon Moses saw the bush burn, that was not consumed, that death chamber was holy ground.  God spoke to that little group of four orphaned girls, and the few dear friends, and as long as we linger here in "the land of the dying" His message will be cherished.  "Our people die well!" wrote John to Charles Wesley, in the early days of Methodism.  Laura Dickson's was a sweet, courageous Christian death.<br> On Sunday afternoon, November 25th, at 3:30 o'clock, the Hawaiian colony resident in Oakland and San Francisco, gathered at the Grand Hotel to pay their tribute of love and affection to one of Hawaii's noblest women.  The use of one of the largest suites of private parlors was generously given by the proprietors, and these were thronged, and a great number stood patiently in the hall-way.  At least two hundred persons were in attendance.  The floral tributes were chaste and beautiful.<br> Rev. J.A. Cruzan, now pastor of the Third Congregational Church, San Francisco, and Mrs. Dickson's pastor in Honolulu for six years, had charge of the services, and was assisted by Rev. Walter Frear, of Oakland, also a former pastor of the deceased.  The service was very beautiful and touching; through it all there ran an undertone of triumph, and of peace, and of victory.  Mr. Cruzan read a brief ritual, Mr. Frear offered the prayer of invocation; Miss Newland and Miss Fox, from Suell's Female Seminary, sang very sweetly, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" to the tune Refuge; Mr. Frear read the 103rd Psalm, John 14th chapter, and the first eight verses of the 21st chapter of Revelation.<br> Mr. Cruzan's address was in substance as follows:  "Life for a term of years in Hawaii tends to give many peculiarities, and one of the pleasantest of these is the close knitting of hearts by the ties of love.  In our isolated life there we come to know each other most intimately, and to love deeply, tenderly, truly.  We Hawaiians do not transplant easily.  The old ties remain ever strong.  A great sorrow, like the death of Laura Dickson, brings us together from our homes around San Francisco Bay, and we are as one great family.  This loss comes home to each of us as a personal loss.  I can therefore speak to you who knew her so intimately and loved her so dearly, as I could not and would not to mere acquaintances.<br> "Laura Dickson was fortunate in many things, but in no one thing was she more blessed than in her birth.  She was well-born.  It has taken science nearly six thousand years to grasp that sturdy old Bible truth, the value of noble ancestry.  As Joseph Cook forcibly puts it, 'In order to stand a fair chance to be born again, a man must be born right the first time.'  To have had for her father such a man as Dr. G.P. Judd, and for her mother such a woman as Laura Fish Judd, was a signal blessing.  It was from these strong characters, and the training which she received at their hands, that Laura Dickson received her marked personality.<br> "Let me voice for you a few of the prominent traits of this noble woman's character.  And, first, she was a strong, positive personality.  We are accustomed to think of strength as a masculine trait.  And yet I believe that the strength to stand for that which is right, at all hazards and costs, is oftener found in woman than in man.  Certainly it was in the character of Laura Dickson, as we seldom find it in men.  She had clear, strong convictions, and the courage of them.  'What is right?' was her first question, and when the answer was clear, she went straight forward, making her way if need be.<br> "Notwithstanding her positiveness and strength, she had no enemies.  During the six years of my residence in Honolulu, I never heard a hard, unkind word spoken against Laura Dickson.  Why?  Because joined with her strength, was a sweetness and tenderness, such as is rarely found.  And here again, we mistake in our thinking; we associate strength with a certain roughness and hardness of character.  No.  The truly strong soul is always the truly tender and loving soul.  What a broad, strong, Christ-like charity was hers, a charity 'that sought not its own, was not easily provoked, and that thought no evil; rejoiced not in iniquity, but in the truth.'<br> "Joined with strength and sweetness, nay, the rich soil out of which these grew, was a strong, childlike faith.  Hers was not an unthinking, unreasoning, inherited faith.  It was a faith that she wrought out for herself.  She could say with Paul, 'I know in whom I have believed.'  Christ's word and will were law to her.<br> "Of her work and influence in Hawaii I do not need to speak.  It is a part of the daily life of Honolulu, and the little Island Kingdom, and Laura Dickson will live in hundreds of lives long after her body has gone back to earth.  Her great heart and strong faith took in all who needed her.  The Honolulu papers are filled with articles upon 'How to reach young men?'  Laura Dickson knew how.  I have had young men again and again say to me, 'I owe what I am to Mrs. Dickson.  Just at the right time she laid a restraining hand on my arm, and turned my feet back into the right path.'  The sick and discouraged strangers, who came in such numbers to Hawaii so late in their quest of health, that they found instead a grave, these she seemed to know of by instinct.  All over America there are homes where the name of Laura Dickson is cherished by bereaved ones, who will feel doubly bereaved when the news comes of the death of her who so kindly ministered to their 'stranger in the strange land' of Hawaii.  The sorrowing, the over-burdened, the sin-bearers, instinctively sought her home and heart for help, and she gladly gave of her strength, her sympathy, her substance, in obedience to her Master's word, 'Bear ye one another's burdens.'  How the natives loved and trusted her! and well they might, for from the depths of her great heart she loved that people to whom her father and mother gave such long, patient, self-sacrificing service.  I dare not trust myself to speak of how much she was to the dear ones in her own home.  You have no need that I should speak, for your thoughts outrun my words.  That home that we all remember so well was like the city that is set upon a hill.  She was a devoted wife and mother.  But that home was more than a haven for a family, it was a haven for all who loved that which is 'true and honest, and of good report.'  And out from its wide-opened hospitable doors there went an influence which was as a tonic to the social life of Honolulu.  God be thanked for such homes, and loving praise to the noble women who create them!<br> "I refuse to think of Laura Dickson as dead.  When Owen was on his death-bed, in dictating a letter to a friend, his amanuensis wrote, 'I am still in the land of the living.'  'No.  Change that,'  said Owen, 'write "I am still in the land of the dying, but hope soon to be in the land of the living."'  We are still in the land of the dying, but she is where there is no death.  We read of that wondrous city of the redeemed, 'And the gates shall in no wise be shut.'  By the eye of faith I look through the fast open gates, and I see one whom we all love, surrounded by a great host; her loved ones are there, and young men whom she has helped, and the strangers to whom she ministered, and the sorrowing whom she comforted, and the swarthy Hawaiians whom she taught the Gospel, these and many others throng about her.  Her lips have drunk of 'the river of water of life clear as crystal;' her hand waves us a welcome; her voice, strong and clear, sings for us the Pauline chant of victory.  'I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.'"<br> Miss Newland and Miss Fox followed the address with the beautiful song "Light after Darkness," and Mr. Cruzan closed the very appropriate service with a tender, sympathetic prayer.  J.A.C.  San Francisco, Dec. 3, 1888.<a href="e3165.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c10246.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 40.  Funeral of Mrs. Dickson.  The body of the late Mrs. Dickson, which was brought embalmed from San Francisco by the steamer Australia, was on Sunday afternoon committed to its last resting place in Nuuanu Cemetery.  There was a large concourse of people at the house of mourning.  Rev. J.A. Beckwith. D.D., and Rev. C.M. Hyde, D.D., conducted the services, each of them delivering an affecting address.  Dr. Beckwith referred to the fact that, when he returned to these shores, the first hand to bridge over the interval of thirty-five years in welcoming him was that of the lamented lady, his beloved pupil of long ago in Oahu College.  Beautiful and appropriate anthems and hymns were sung by the choir of Central Union Church.  Floral offerings were on a scale of magnificence, the interior walls of the residence being covered with them, some rising to a height of several feet from the floor.  The smaller tributes were simply innumerable and comprised many chaste and lovely emblems of a saintly life and of immortal hope.  Princess Liliuokalani, accompanied by Hon. J.O. Dominis, attended at the house.  It was impossible, almost, to think of anybody of distinction in any walk of life in the community, and not find that such person, lady or gentleman, was among the assemblage to pay the last tribute of esteem to the truly eminent departed one.  People of every nationality were there, including many natives of both sexes.  The pall-bearers were Hon. S.M. Damon, Hon. A.S. Hartwell, Hon. W.D. Alexander, Hon. Henry Waterhouse, Hon. J.B. Atherton, Mr. P.C. Jones, Mr. C.M. Cooke, and Captain Staples.  A platoon of police acted as bearers of the casket.  A very long procession of carriages fell in behind those of the numerous company of chief mourners.<a href="e3164.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c10246.6">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 40.  Mrs. Laura Fish Judd Dickson, was a daughter of the late Dr. G.P. Judd, and a twin sister to Col. C.H. Judd, born Sept. 8, 1835, at the old mission premises, Honolulu.  The Chief Justice and Chancellor of the Kingdom, Hon. A.F. Judd, is another brother.  She was married in 1862 to Joshua G. Dickson, who died in 1880.  A tribute to the memory of the lamented lady by Rev. J.A. Cruzan appears elsewhere.<a href="e3160.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c10257.3">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 46.  The Hastings-Day Wedding.  It is seldom that we have an opportunity to witness so pretty and novel a wedding as the one which occurred last Wednesday evening at the Central church, the contracting parties being Miss Harriet Day, only daughter of Mr. Robert E. Day, and Mr. Henry E. Hastings, of this city.  The church, which has not celebrated a wedding for many a month, was tastefully trimmed about the pulpit and platform with growing plants, ferns and choice flowers.  The body of the church was well filled with our best society people, and many of the costumes worn by the ladies were striking and handsome.  While the guests were being seated Mr. Benjamin W. Loveland, organist of the Church of the Good Shepherd, and a particular friend of the groom, played the overture to "Pearl of Bagdad," by Loretz.  "Rustie March," "Nuptial March" and several other selections which were greatly enjoyed.  At the appointed time the bridal chorus from "Lohrengrim" announced the entrance of the bridal party in the following order:  Four ushers, Messrs. Louis A. Tracy, Frank Bishop, Charles E. Hastings and Charles R. Hansell, followed by the four bridesmaids, Miss Carrie E. Hastings, sister of the groom, Miss Alice Bennett, Miss Nellie Day, from Norwich, and Miss Nellie Whitney, who were all attired in costumes of white silk, carrying bunches of Marechal Niel roses.  Directly behind them came the bride and groom.  The bride was most becomingly attired in a gown of white faille silk, the entire front being of silver-striped brocade.  The open corsage was trimmed with lovely lace and her ornaments were pearls.  The veil of tulle was caught to the hair by jeweled pins.  This certainly was a most becoming and choice costume.  They were met at the alter by the Rev. Dr. Walker, who performed the marriage ceremony, which was simple, during which the soft, sweet strains of "Traumerli" sounded through the church like some far distant music, changing again into the wedding march as the bridal party left the altar.<br> After the ceremony at the church Mr, and Mrs Hastings held a reception at the bride's home on Buckingham street, where they were assisted by Mr. and Mrs. Day and the bridal party in receiving a large number of their friends.  An orchestra discoursed sweet music at intervals, and the entire house was thrown open to the guests.<br> The wedding presents were exhibited in a large room and were particularly rich and handsome.  Among the guests present were, Mr. and Mrs. F.B. Cooley, Mr. and Mrs. Judson H. Root, Mr. and Mrs. W.H. Bulkeley, Mr. and Mrs. Cone, Mr. and Mrs. Martin Bennet, Miss Chamberlin, of Albany, Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Walker, Dr. and Mrs. Parker, Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Harbinson, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lincoln, the Misses Lincoln, Mr. and Mrs. Leverett Brainard, Miss Brainard, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Prentice, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Prentice, Mr. Cooley, Mr. Lucius Robinson, Mr. Burton Parker, Mr. and Mrs. Willard, Miss Marcy, Judge Sill, Miss Sill, Miss Hudson, Miss Storrs, Miss Pendleton, Mr. Storrs, Mrs. Hudson, Mr. Wadsworth, Miss Wadsworth, Mr. and Mrs. Case, Miss Tyler, Mr. and Mrs. Bryant, Dr. Hastings, Mr. Frank Hastings, Mr. and Mrs. Post.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Hastings left on the evening express south, for a short trip to New York and the south, and on their return will occupy their new residence upon Elm street, which has been remodeled and fitted for them.  They will receive their friends on Wednesdays after December 1, at 71 Elm street.  Each guest on leaving the house was presented with a dainty souvenir of the wedding in the shape of a white satin bag of wedding cake bearing the initial of the bride and groom and the date in gold lettering.  The ushers Messrs. Hansell, Day, Brockway, Tracy and Bishop, were each presented with handsome four leaf scarf pins with rubies, while the bridesmaids received gold hairpins.<a href="e3166.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
