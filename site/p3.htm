Hastings, page 3.  <b>Death of Seth Hastings, M.D.</b>  The death of this venerable man, known to so many of the first settlers of Oneida county as an eminent physician, occurred in Clinton the 26 ult., in the 81st year of his age. For about ten years Mr. Hastings had been laid aside hy paralysis, which affected his limbs and speech.  His long confinement was however a period of cheerful serenity - the calm close of a long Summer day - awaiting till his change should come.  He succeeded his father in the practice of medicine in that community, and during the forty years of his active life was ever as ready and able to administer to spiritual as to physical necessities.  His disposition was most social and kindly, and like his brother (the late Orlando Hastings, Esq., of Rochester), who went before him scarcely a week, he has been a pillar in the church.  A large family of children rise up and call him blessed, of  whom  Rev. Eurotas Hastings, missionary to Ceylon, is one.<a href="e3098.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c62.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 17.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Late Dr. Hastings.  Died, in this village, on the 26th ult., Seth Hastings, M.D., aged 81 years.  The decease of so important a citizen, calls for a more extended notice than the ordinary obituary record.  Dr. Hastings was born in Washington, Ct., Aug. 23d 1780, and when seventeen years old, came with his parents to Clinton.  His father before him was a physician of extensive practice.  The son, having completed his academic and professional studies, was taken into partnership with his father, in the year 1801, he then being 21 years of age.  The young doctor grew in public esteem, from year to year, until at length he became the leading physician of the place.  His services were also much sought for in the adjoining towns of this county.  Other physicians of high repute established themselves in Clinton, but Dr. Hastings, we believe, maintained the largest practice.  After nearly fifty years of useful labor, he was afflicted with a stroke of paralysis, which rendered him almost speechless and physically helpless.  From that time, until his death, a period of ten years, while deprived of nearly all social intercourse and personal enjoyment, he was watched over by the tenderest filial care, and supplied with everything needful for his comfort.  At his funeral, in addition to the resident members of the family, many of his relations from abroad were present: two brothers, four sons, a son-in-law and a nephew.  The funeral services were held in the Congregational church, and were conducted by the Pastor, and by Revs. Mr. Strong and Prof. Upson.  The tributes which these gentlemen paid to the memory of the deceased were as deserved as they were interesting.  Mr. Strong, in particular, spoke from a life-long acquaintance with Dr. H., and his manner showed that he spoke from the heart.  On the Sabbath following his funeral, Rev. Mr. Swift preached an appropriate sermon with references to the deceased from the words: "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We can hardly add anything to the testimonials given on the above occasions; nor shall we attempt any labored analysis of this venerable man's character.  Possessed of good native endowments, he cultivated them by life-long reading and observation.  His social character was very marked.  Amiable, cheerful, hopeful, with a smile and a kind word for everybody, he diffused happiness all around him.  He loved to find the sunny side of life, and did much to make it sunny.  This trait of character helped to render him an agreeable and successful physician.  His house was the home of a generous hospitality.  For many years, it was seldom without its guests from all parts of the country.  He was particularly fond of social gathering in which music formed a leading part of the entertainment.  On Thanksgiving evenings, for many successive years, his parlors were filled with family friends, old and young, of a musical turn, and the walls echoed with joyful singing.  The tunes selected were old and new, long and short, half-forgotten and familiar, those with a decidedly ancient odor having the preference.  On such occasions, Dr. Hastings seemed to be in his true element.  He was leader of the choir in the Old White Meeting House, for several years; and until laid aside in the year 1851, he usually conducted the singing of the church on Communion Sabbaths, and at all social meetings.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The religious character of Dr. Hastings, was not the least of his excellencies.  Humble, prayerful, earnest, his piety showed itself in his household, in the prayer-meeting, amid his professional pursuits, and in all other walks of life.  But of these things, so fully exhibited on the funeral occasion, we need not now further speak.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a great loss to Clinton, when Dr. Hastings was withdrawn from public life.  He was, from the first, one of the leading minds in this town, and did much to determine and mold its character.  He was the friend of temperance, and order, morality, education and religion.  He was eminently a peace-maker.  He was interested in all good public enterprises, and helped them forward according to his ability.  He did much to introduce new and improved varieties of fruits into this region, and set a good example in the way of ornamental gardening.  But we need not prolong this sketch the subject of it will long live in the hearts of all who knew him.  The memory of the just is blessed.<a href="e3143.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

This trait of character helped to make him an agreeable and successful physician.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;About the year 1808 he built the red brick house, which has been known for ninety years as the "Hastings Homestead."  It was sold shortly after the death of Dr. Hastings, and within the past year it has been repaired, though its original plan has been preserved as far as possible, and it is now used as a bank.  A recent paper read before the Rural Art Society, of Clinton, mentions the doorway and parlor mantlepiece of this house as being good examples of colonial art.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was a home of generous hospitality.  For many years it was seldom without its guests from all parts of the country.  Dr. Hastings was particularly fond of social gatherings in which music formed a leading part of the entertainment.

The tunes selected were old and new, long and short, half-forgotten and familiar; those with a decidedly ancient odor having the preference.  On such occasions Dr. Hastings seemed to be in his true element.  It was been said that one "could seldom pass the old brick mansion without hearing either vocal or instrumental music, or both."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His love of horticulture made his garden and orchard remarkable for that time.  In that part known as the "Botanical Garden" was to be found nearly every native plant, and many others sent by correspondents from distant section of the country.  He was constantly adding new varieties of fruit to his collection, and by careful selection of the more hardly kinds he secured a bountiful supply of fine fruit the entire year.</li>
<li id="c62.7">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 26 and 28.  Some recollections of Clinton and Vicinity.  Fifth Paper.  A Notable Clinton Family.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The name of Hastings is historic.  The reader of English history and literature has often met with it.  As a locality it gave its name to one of the decisive battles of the world, in which the Saxon king Harold was slain, and William the Norman became master of England, and changed its civilization and destiny.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first and greatest governor of India was a Hastings, and in his biography Macauley says:  "The undoubted splendor of the name of Hastings needs no illustration from fable.  One branch of that line wore in the fourteenth century the coronet of Pembroke.  From another branch sprang the renowned chamberlain, the faithful adherent of the White Rose, whose fate has furnished so striking a theme both to poets and historians."  But it is no part of my purpose to show how, or by whom the name was made illustrious in old England.  It was brought thither by Thomas Hastings and his wife, Susanna, who on the 10th of April, 1634, embarked at Ipswich in the good ship Elizabeth, to which in due time arrived at Boston.  I do not know whether Thomas belonged to the aristocracy, but I suspect he was a good Puritan.  He settled in Watertown, Mass., and he and Susanna gave the family of Hastings a good start in America with eight children.  And here may be noted a striking difference between this and other noted families.  All others, so far as I know, started with the emigration of three brothers, one of who settled in New England, one in New Jersey or Pennsylvania, and the third in the south.  But fortunately, in the case of the Hastings family, there was but <i>one.</i>  I say <i>fortunately</i> solely on the score of room, for if all who have borne this name, were like those it has been the writers good fortune to know, the county would have been no worse in other respects if the orthodox number of three had emigrated, and been equally prolific.  I cannot of course show how, from this Thomas and his children the name of Hastings spread over the land.  One family alone claims the writer's notice.  Ten years after Moses Foote and company camped upon the ground now known as Clinton village, and after the settlement had been reinforced by sundry additions from the same state of Connecticut, a descendant of Thomas Hastings, Seth by name, a physician, thirty-three years of age, with his wife, Eunice Parmelee, whom he had married when she was only sweet sixteen, with the eight children that had been born to them in Connecticut, left Washington in that state for the new west.  The fame of Clinton had become well-known in many a Connecticut town that had sent its contributions of sturdy men and lovely women to its vicinity, and thither the said Seth and family bent their steps.  They settled on a farm about two miles south of Clinton, on the road to Paris Hill, and there the doctor and his wife remained until their death, the wife dying in 1821, and the doctor in 1830, at the good old age of 85.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To this couple were born in Clinton three more children, making a total of eleven.  The list is as follows:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seth, born August 23, 1780.  This was the head of the well-known family in the village, who following the profession of his father, studying and practicing with him for some years.  At the age of twenty-two he married Huldah Clark, daughter of John and Anne Clark, who had emigrated from Colchester, Conn., in 1797.  This couple are the hero and heroine of our story, but we leave them for a little and continue the list of Seth, senior.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Betsy, born August 28, 1782, became the wife of Doctor Elnathan Judd, of Paris Hill, and the mother of Doctor Gerrett Judd, who in 1827, married Laura Fish, a teacher in Miss Royce's school, and in the same year went as missionary to the Sandwich Islands.  He afterwards became very conspicuous in the history of the Islands.  Mrs. Betsy Judd after the death of her husband, went to the Islands and died at her son's in 1876.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thomas, born October 15, 1784.  This was the celebrated musical teacher, composer and poet, and whilom leader of the village choir.  He died May 15, 1872, leaving behind him a name dear to the Christian church.  There are in the well known "Songs of the Sanctuary," nineteen tunes and twenty-seven hymns composed by him.  Rev. Thos. S. Hastings, a graduate of Hamilton college, class of 1848, and now a professor in the Union Theological seminary, of New York, is his son.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eunice, born October 22, 1786, died January 10, 1788.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Orlando, born March 7, 1789, died March 19, 1861.  He, with the next on the list, was once a merchant in Clinton, afterwards a prominent lawyer in Rochester, N.Y.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eurotas P., born July 20, 1791, died June 1, 1886, a banker in Detroit, Mich.  The tune "Detroit," found in the "Songs of the Sanctuary," was composed by him.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles, born September 2, 1793, died March 28, 1848.  He kept a book and stationery store in Utica for some years, and afterwards was a Michigan farmer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Polly Sophia, born April 14, 1796, died June 10, 1803.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Truman, born August 29, 1798, died October 17, 1884.  A lawyer, first at Rochester, N.Y., afterwards at Cleveland, O.  Thomas, Orlando and Truman, were albinos.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Albert M., born July 16, 1804, died October 4, 1828.  A merchant in Niagara county, N.Y.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eunice Sophia, born Sept. 22, 1809, died October 14, 1849.  Married Dr. W. Smith, who died a little over a year after.  Married again in 1840 to Levi Trowbridge, of Michigan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to return to the tribe of Dr. Seth, the second.  To him and his wife Huldah were born in Clinton fifteen children, all of whom, save one, reached the age of maturity.  The list is as follows:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Clark, born June 10, 1803, died August 28, 1880.  He married Martha Parker, of Utica, where he was for some years a well-known merchant.  As all Clinton people well know, he was afterwards a nurseryman and landscape gardener in Clinton.  Many places in Clinton, especially the college grounds and the cemetery, are proofs of his skill and good taste.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sophia, born May 26, 1805, died Nov. 28, 1876.  Became the wife of Rev. A.S. Wells, a well-known pioneer missionary in Michigan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George, born March 13, 1807, died August 29, 1866, a respected and successful lawyer of Mount Morris, N.Y.  A graduate of Hamilton college, class of '26.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Juliet, born December 18, 1808, died August 30, 1848, became the wife of Rev. Wayne Gridley, of Clinton, five years pastor of the Congregationalist church.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seth Merwin, born March 14, 1810, died in infancy.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Daniel H., born April 20, 1811, died February 24, 1884.  Was a merchant and afterwards a physician in New York city.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seth P.M., born April 21, 1813, died February 24, 1876.  Was a minister settled in Ulster county, N.Y.  Married Elizabeth Buttrick, of Clinton, who also died in Ulster county.  Was a graduate of Hamilton college, class of '33<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Francis H., born November 23, 1814.  I am happy to say that "uncle Frank" still lives.  He tried for some years to make trees grow at Bridgeport, Chicago; gave it up and sold out and became a fruit gardener, near Rochester, N.Y.  Married Amelia, daughter of the late Hon. Daniel Gott, of Syracuse, N.Y.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Panett M., born August 17, 1816.  Is a practicing physician at Hartford, Conn., where he married Jane Sheldon.  Was a graduate of Hamilton college, class of '38, and was for two years one of the "praelectores" of the college.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mary Alida, born March 11, 1818.  Married James Sibley, a prominent merchant of Cincinnati, O.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elizabeth Ann, born September 27, 1819, died March 2, 1863.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Eurotas P., born April 17, 1821.  Is a minister and missionary at Ceylon.  Married Anne Cleveland, a sister of President Cleveland.  A graduate of Hamilton college, class of '42.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Caroline S., born February 17, 1823, lives at Cincinnati.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Francis E., born June 7, 1825, died April 8, 1875.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edward A., born May 28, 1828, and still living at Clinton, completes the chapter.  The mantle of the oldest in the list has fallen upon the youngest.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I well remember when the last named was born, having that morning called as usual at the Hastings mansion for company to the old Academy.  Seth was, or pretended to be, greatly disgusted with this addition to the catalog.  But he did not pout long and it is not to be supposed that his playing mugwump had any influence in closing the list at No. 15.  The old doctor wore a broader smile than usual.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is not on the score of numbers alone that this family has been selected for notice in these sketches.  It was a most remarkable family in its morals.  In neither of the two flocks of Seth was there a black sheep.  The writer, first and last, has been somewhat acquainted with their history, and never heard of anything disreputable of any member.  As has been noticed it has embraced merchants, bankers, horticulturists, lawyers, ministers, missionaries and professors.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is one of the mysteries how Dr. Hastings, with the moderate fees of a country practitioner of that day, could bring up such a family and give them all a good education, and make for them such a pleasant and comfortable home.  Verily the old sulky did not rest much.  I suppose that all were Christians.  What a family will that be in heaven!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr. Hastings was in some respects a remarkable man.  His temperament was happy, cheerful, and often mirthful.  It must have been a blue day indeed when his face did nor wear a smile.  Often did it fall to the lot of the writer to see him open his saddlebags, or his little chest, and dose out his pills and powders, with a smile that was better than sugar-coating, or other art of modern pharmacy.  He was eminently a peace-maker in church and society, and his heart always seemed to be full of that charity which "suffereth long and is kind."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I have spoken of Thomas Hastings as the singer, &c.  But all the Hastings' I think, were addicted to music.  It was a family gift.  One could seldom pass the old brick mansion without hearing either vocal or instrumental music, or both.  Dr. Hastings was also noted for his love of horticulture.  He always had the finest garden, shrubbery and fruits in the place, and within and without there was no more attractive home in old Clinton.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What his sons and grandsons and his brothers have done to perpetuate the honored name of Hastings, it is no part of my purpose to record.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it were allowable to conjecture that the Lord God had appeared to old Thomas of England and said:  "Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation." surely enough has been recorded to show that he is still the same covenant-keeping God that he was in the days of Abraham.

<li id="c62.8">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 36.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seth Hastings, Jr., the oldest son, became like his father, a physician, and settled in Clinton.  For some forty years he enjoyed a very successful practice, rarely if ever exceeded in respect and profit in any of the country districts of central New York.  He was blessed with a numerous and prosperous family of children, fourteen of whom he was permitted to raise to mature life.  The late Hon. George Hastings, M.C., of Mt. Morris, the late Rev. Seth Hastings, of Chittenango, N.Y., the Rev. Eurotas P. Hastings, now of the Ceylon mission, Panett M. Hastings, M.D., of Hartford, Conn., were among his sons.  Other sons were distinguished in different lines of business.  Of his daughters two became wives of clergymen, another the wife of a well-known business man of Cincinnati, all of them parents of sons and daughters too numerous to mention, none of whom, to my knowledge, have ever disgraced their parentage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thomas Hastings, the sweet singer in our Israel, editor for some years of the religious paper published in Utica, N.Y., since more widely known as musical professor in New York city, was the second son.  His work is too well known, his reputation, with that of his excellent wife, is too well established to need any word of eulogy from me.  Their two daughters became wives of eminent missionaries, and have gone to their rest, while their only son, the Rev. Thomas S. Hastings, D.D., pastor of the West church, New York city, is left as the lone, yet worthy representative of that branch of the family.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Orlando Hastings, the eminent counselor for many late years, until his death well known as a leader in the Central Presbyterian church of Rochester, was the third son.  His standing as a lawyer, as a Christian, can be attested by nearly all Rochester, and certainly by all connected with the Central church.  His son, the Rev. Parsons C. Hastings, of Brooklyn, is well known.  Another of the sons of Dr. Seth Hastings, Sen., was the late Eurotas P. Hastings, of Detroit.  His career from his clerkship with Ephraim Hart, in Utica, N.Y., through his cashiership with Dr. Henry Dwight, banker in Geneva and in Detroit, during his presidency of the old bank of Michigan, and as a prominent Christian citizen and an officer in Dr. Duffield's church, is an unbroken history of success of honor and usefulness.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Charles Hastings, the father of the late Rev. Albert E. Hastings, pastor of the Union Presbyterian church in Detroit, was another son of this remarkable family.  He was for many years well  known as the firm of Merrell & Hastings, booksellers in Utica, N.Y.  This firm were the publishers of the Religious Newspaper, edited by Thomas Hastings.  On the dissolution of the firm, some forty-five years since, he removed to Troy, Mich., when, as more conducive to his health, [  ] had become impaired, he promoted [  ] pursuits maintaining in his modest, retiring, yet useful life, as he had ever before done, the reputation of a sincere and devout Christian gentleman.  The character and usefulness of his son, the late Albert E. Hastings, is a testimony to the excellence and fidelity of his parents.  That the death of the son is mourned by a "wide circle of friends and admires" is readily believed by those who knew those parents.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Truman Hastings, the last to be mentioned of the sons, I believe, is yet living.  He was associated many years with his brother Orlando in the practice of law, and of established merit, although he was, of course, overshadowed by the prominence of his brother.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It only remains to speak of the daughter. Betsey Hastings married Dr. Elnathan Judd.  They were the parents of Dr. Gerrit P. Judd, who more than fifty years since went to the Sandwich Islands as a missionary-physician under the care of the American board.  After serving several years in that capacity, so marked with his ability and so well fitted was he thought to be for the highest civil service in the state, that he was released from his service to the board that he might accept the invitation of the king to become his secretary of state or prime minister.  During a long course of honorable service in this capacity he was eminently useful in guiding the affairs of that infant state, ever mindful of the high interests of virtue and religion.  During his long official career in the interests of the king he twice visited Great Britain and the United States, taking with him the princess, heir-apparent to the throne, to make them personally acquainted with the condition of these enlightened Christian nations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A daughter of Dr. Judd, the elder, and Mrs. Judd, was married to Mr. Bates, a lawyer of eminence, who also went to the Sandwich Islands and served the king in an official capacity.  After the death of her husband, Mrs. Betsey Judd, with an unmarried daughter, also went to the Sandwich Islands and spent the remainder of her days enjoying the prosperity of the people to which her children had so largely contributed, and participating with them in the respect and honors they had so richly merited.  She lived to pass her ninetieth birthday which was celebrated by a remarkable party, to which all the aged grandmothers of Honolulu were invited.  Three of these sons of Mr. Hastings, Sen., were Albinos, which should be considered in forming our estimate of their usefulness.  In this was found probably the severest test of the faith of their parents.  To them the question, how can these almost blind and helpless ones, gain a living.  Their anxiety on this account was well known in the circle of their intimate friends.  Their only resource was to the loving care and providence of him who had ordered their infirmity, and richly was their confidence rewarded.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I have written this sketch, not that any one of these persons named excelled all others, but because taken all together their history will rarely find a parallel illustrating that benefit of a sound Christian education, and the riches of divine grace in the fulfillment of covenant promises.  It was my privilege to know quite intimately this entire circle, and I can testify to their eminent position and usefulness in their several spheres, and wish to say in conclusion that I regarded their friendship among the richest blessings of my social life.<a href="e3159.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c62.9">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 27B.  I remember the two family doctors of my native village, Clinton, New York.  One was the cheeriest, merriest little old gentleman.  His face was always rippling with smiles.  He was deacon; and on communion Sabbaths (the profane Devil dispensed with) he stood in front of the pulpit and sang Dundee or Mear, and tried to look solemn.  As I think of him, standing there, with his round sunny head and his round sunny face, he comes up in my memory like those pictures of Sol in the old almanacs.  But the other was a tall, sharp-faced, somber, unsympathetic man; and he was "our doctor."  I think I should weigh fifty pounds more today if I had had the other doctor.  My childhood was loomed over by that sunless, comfortless, excellent, wise man, who cured me, but never cheered me.  There is physic in the bright faces and the joyous, bracing, tender tones of some people.  Dr. Seth Hastings, Jr., was the merry one.</li>

Hastings, the landscape gardener in charge of the work of laying out the extensive grounds of the Fiske property, occurred at one o'clock this afternoon of pneumonia, at the residence of Mrs. J. W. Williams, on the campus. Mr. Hastings was taken with a severe cold on Thursday last, but he continued to attend to his duties and refused to have a doctor, remarking that he did not think he needed one. He grew worse and was finally obliged to take to his room. Yesterday he was visited by Architect W. H. Miller who was surprised and alarmed to find him suffering from pneumonia. The Architect insisted upon having a physician called and Mr. Hastings eventually consented. Dr. Winslow was soon in attendance and did all that could be done, but the disease had become deeply seated and baffled all attempts to conquer it. <br> Mr. Hastings was quite an old man, his age being about seventy. His home was at Clinton, Oneida county, whither news of his death has been telegraphed. He was known throughout the state and country as an enthusiast in horticulture and one of the best landscape artists of the times. He came to Ithaca a few weeks ago and under his supervision the rugged surface of the Fiske property was fast being transformed into a private park of the utmost beauty. The particulars of Mr. Hastings' burial cannot be decided upon until his friends are heard from. He dies a widower, his wife having preceded him to the undiscovered country by a number of years.<a href="e3096.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c64.4">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 3.  IN MEMORIAM. John C. Hastings.  John Clark Hastings (son of Dr. Seth Hastings and Huldah Clark) was born in Clinton, June 10, 1803.  He married, Aug. 17, 1829, Martha ("Patty") Ann Parker, daughter of Jason Parker, of Utica.  They were childless.  She died some years since, in this place, and greatly regretted, by those who knew her best, for her many excellencies of character.  Mr. Hastings, although engaged for several years in mercantile pursuits in Utica, spent most of his active life in this place.  Beginning, some 30 years ago or more, his course of active effort here as florist and nurseryman, he early connected with it, and at first in quite a moderate and modest way, the practice of landscape gardening.  And so marked was his success in this direction, here, in his native town, that his fame spread erelong far and wide over the land.  He was summoned at various times to Massachusetts (especially, Stockbridge) and Pennsylvania (Gettysburgh) and various places of note in our own State (Syracuse, Ithaca, &c.) to lay out large private grounds and public parks and cemeteries.  The college campus and our village cemetery will always remain as special monuments to his praise, a praise which neither he, nor his personal friends, would regard as at all impaired, but rather as heightened, because being shared with him by other kindred spirits in taste, such as Prof. Root, Rev. A. D. Gridley and others.<br> He was one of the original founders (12 in number), twenty-five years ago, of The Rural Art Association, which has done so much to beautify this place, beyond other places of its size throughout the land.<br> He was in many ways, if unostentatious yet none the less effective, a practical benefactor to Clinton; and his name deserves to be held in lasting remembrance here, as that on one of its best and truest men.  In his death, as in that of several others of recent occurrence, we lose an old and valued citizen of our village, whose place will not be likely to be made good by any successor of like excellence.<br> The Hastings' family was, but a little while ago, within the memory of many of the older inhabitants of Clinton, the largest family for numbers in it.  Dr. Seth Hastings was the father of 14 children.  Not one of them now resides in the town, or in its vicinity; and when Mr. John Hastings died, there was not one of that large family, or, of their once many relatives here and at Utica, to care tenderly for his remains, and to see that they were borne to his own home for burial, or receive them on their arrival.  Those solemn offices of domestic affection were, however, rendered with generous carefulness, by the son of one of the most intimate friends, Prof. Oren Root, Jr, just arrived in the place.<br> He died, of pneumonia, at Ithaca, N.Y., on Wednesday, Aug. 25th.  He had undertaken to lay out the grounds (some 37 acres) of Mrs. Prof. Fiske, in that place, so as to give them their best ornamental effect, and had 150 workmen employed at the time, with 25 teams, for the purpose.  He had been for some 6 weeks thus busily engaged, and was pressing on energetically towards the end in view, when he caught, a few days before he died, the cold which ended in his death.  The day before he died he was out among his men, giving direction to their work, and he ordered a carriage to call for him the next morning of the day, at whose noon he ceased to breathe.  So determined was he to keep on working to the very end; and so great was his tenacity of life, and his steady strength of will.  It is pleasant to know that he suffered but little from a disease, which in most cases, is remarkable of the acute distress which is causes to its sufferer.<br> Throughout all his long life, Mr. Hastings has always stood up in this community for what has seemed to him right and best, and, while not aggressive, has been yet fearless, in expressing his individual convictions.  He has been, likewise, one of our most public-spirited citizens, and especially, when considering his moderate pecuniary means, in advocating and promoting town-improvements of all sorts.<br> He has been, for many years past, a quiet but consistent member of the Presbyterian church, and died in peace with God and man.  He was noted among his friends for not only the simplicity and transparency of his character, and his unassuming modesty on all occasions, but also for his moral refinement of feeling, and his fealty to the suggestions of an enlightened conscience, in his opinions and actions.<br> Considering how slender was his physical frame, and how frail and even fragile his natural constitution seemed to be, he attained to a great age, by carefully husbanding what resources of health and strength he did possess.  Clinton has been regularly and rapidly becoming poorer, every year, for several years past, in the number of its better citizens, by the removal of some and the death of many.  And, to not a few, the death of Mr. Hastings seems to be a sad addition, indeed, to many like experiences occurring in recent succession before it.<a href="e3097.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c64.5">[<a href="s1.htm#s207">S207</a>] Francis H. Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 30.  Mr. Hastings was for some years a very successful merchant in Utica, but his whole fortune was swept away in the panic of 1837.  The following year he removed to Clinton, where the remainder of his life was passed.  He engaged in the nursery business, which he followed for many years.  He will be best remembered as a most artistic landscape gardener.  He was past middle life when he first devoted himself to this pursuit, for which he had a remarkable talent.  His chief principle was to follow, in the treatment of a place, the hints given by nature, and there are many beautiful examples of his art in various cities through the State of New York as well as in other places. <br> As notable among his works may be mentioned the new cemetery and the campus of Hamilton College, the beautiful grounds of Prof. Root and Dr. A. D. Gridley, and his own garden, all in Clinton.  He did much to encourage the making of beautiful homes by founding, with Prof. Root, his life-long friend, the "Rural Art Society," of Clinton, an association composed of the leading citizens, and still, as for very many years, an active force in the community.  However, his crowning life-work was left unfinished, and as he had not drawn the plan completely, it was found to be impossible to entirely follow out his design.  He was engaged, without restriction as to expense, to lay out the Fisk-McGraw grounds (now owned by Cornell University) at Ithaca.  Enough had been done to prove that this would have been his masterpiece, when a sudden cold developed pneumonia, and he died after only a few hours' illness.<br> Kind hearted and generous, he possessed the artistic temperament in large degree.  He grew up at a time when in meeting an older person of any social standing, a well-behaved child was expected to stand aside and doff his cap, and his fine manners of the old-school resulted from this early training.</li>

Died, at Fairfield, Iowa, Dec. 14th, 1868 Sophia H. wife of Rev. A.S. Wells, aged 63 1/2 years.  Her disease was the second stroke of paralysis.<br> She never recovered her consciousness and was unable to give the parting salutations of an affectionate wife and mother, or an assurance of the triumph over death, in the last conflict, by the faith of Jesus.<br> The latter, however, we are allowed to draw from her life, for more than forty years.  She has during all these years chosen the society of God's people, searched the Scriptures daily, and loved the worship of God in all its forms. Of late she has felt an unusual interest on the subject of personal religion, and in all the special means employed to promote the piety and fruitfulness of the church.  Although she was not an active a Christian worker as she would have been if she had not been hindered by a mistaken apprehension of the text "Let your women keep silence in the churches," yet we cannot doubt that she received and rested upon Christ as the Rock of her salvation, and the only foundation of her hope; or that she died in the Lord, and therefore sleeps in Jesus.<br> Her death, although sudden and unexpected by all, was an easy one; and she will be greatly missed not only by her bereaved companion and affectionate children, but by a wide circle of acquaintances and friends.  May it lead us all to be ready to live to the Lord, and then we shall be sure of a happy death and of a glorious immortality.

One by one those who for nearly half a century have assisted in giving character to the history of our county are removed by death.  After a lingering illness, which he bore with Christian resignation, on the 29th inst, the Hon. George Hastings, of this village, departed this life, after a life of eminent usefulness, holding frequent positions of trust and honor, both County and State.  Judge Hastings was the son of Dr. Seth Hastings, of Clinton, N.Y.  He was born in March, 1807; graduating with high honors at Hamilton College in the year 1826, he immediately entered the law office of Thos. E. Clark, Esq, at Utica.  In October, 1830, he was admitted to the bar and removed to this village.  In 1839 he was appointed District Attorney, which position most acceptably to the people he held till June, 1847.  In the year 1853 he was chosen Representative to the 33d Congress, and nobly represented our district, defending by a speech of great ability the famous Nebraska Bill.  In 1855 he was elected Judge of the Co., retaining that position till 1863.  No Judge on our bench has ever presided with more dignity, independence, integrity and firmness.  He was an able lawyer and counselor; at the bar he adorned and gave character to the profession; while on the bench he exhibited patient research and a comprehensive intellect.  His opinions were always received with great confidence and profound respect.  Few men have served with public so long and faithfully, leaving such a spotless reputation.  Since he left the judicial bench he has held no public position, though ever earnest and active in defense of the constitutional powers of our government.  In our late sanguinary contest, two sons and a son-in-law, with his desire and assistance, were engaged in the defense of our country.  During the past year three ex-judges of our county have been removed by death - Judge Smith of Caledonia, Judge Carroll of Groveland, and now our worth citizen, Judge Hastings.  A good man has fallen - ripe in wisdom, full of honors, his memory embalmed in every heart - cherishing no unkindness to any with a record unblemished, noble and honorable.  "He needs no tears who lived a noble life. / We will not weep for him who died so well; / But we will gather round the hearth / And tell the story of his strife, / Such homage suits him will, / Better than formal prop or passing bell."<a href="e3109.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 39 - 41.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George Hastings, son of Dr. Seth and Huldah Clark Hastings, born at Clinton, March 13, 1807; died at Mt. Morris, Livingston County, N. Y., August 29, 1866.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He married, first, Mary Seymour, daughter of Norman Seymour.  She was born at Herkimer, N. Y., July 31, 1808.  She died in Mt. Morris, February 25, 1845, in the 37th year, leaving five children.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He married, second, May 25, 1847, Chloe Arzelia Parmele, daughter of Asa Harmon and Emily (Cole) Parmele.  She was born August 25, 1813; died at Mt. Morris, February 21, 1891, in the 78th year of her age.  She was the mother of four children.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Hastings graduated at Hamilton College in the class of 1826, and studied law with his uncle, Thomas Emmons Clark, in Utica.  He settled in Mr. Morris, N. Y., in 1830.  "He was not, in any sense, a politician, but it can truthfully be said that no man has lived in that community who commanded the confidence of his fellow-citizens to a greater degree."  He was elected, successively, Supervisor (1851), District Attorney (serving in that capacity for eight years), member of Congress (1852-1854), and County Judge (1855-1863).  He was honored with numerous other positions of trust, and was well known throughout western New York, and as widely esteemed for his integrity of character and useful life.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With his large interest in public affairs, and the claims of an unusually extensive practice in his profession, he was always deeply interested in religious work, and he was constant in his attendance at church and Sunday-school, and the prayer-meeting.  He also observed the good Puritan custom of beginning each day by first seeking Divine help and blessing at the family altar.  One of the precious memories to his children must always be these morning prayers during the last few months of his life, when the whole family met in his sick room.  Though wasted by a torturing disease, his calm courage and serene faith made it a place of peace, and no voice was so joyful as his in the songs of praise or so confident in asking strength for the duties of the day.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For nearly fifty years his beautiful home, Oak Grove, has been noted for its hospitality, and the family connection and acquaintance being large, each Summer-season brought numerous guests, who always met a cordial welcome, and who bore away delightful memories of the time spent in this charming homestead.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The following tribute to the memory of Mrs. Chloe Parmele Hastings appeared in the <i>New York Observer</i>, at the time of her death, and it is so truly descriptive of her character that it is here given:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thus ended the long life of a woman of rare endowments, marked spiritual power, and wide influence.  The element of self-sacrifice entered into her life and character to a wonderful degree.  She was, therefore, a woman of heroic impulses and large sympathies.  Hers was no narrow world, bounded on all sides by limitations.  She never recognized failure as a probability, and was always able to see in mysterious Providences a wise fatherhood, controlling and directing all things in orderly ways.  So it was that what men ordinarily account as defeat and disaster, was to her a part of a Divine scheme, reaching from and connecting the finite to the Infinite.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"With all her strength of character, she was conspicuous for her gentleness.  Her loving arms were always extended to those who had tasted the bitterness of great sorrow.  Literally, she wept and sorrowed with them, and all who knew the wealth of her great sour were assured of its bountiful sympathy and kinship in all emergencies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She was a woman of thorough culture, at home in the world of books and deeply versed in the knowledge of the Scriptures.  Added to a keen intellectual grasp of the teaching of the Word was that large spiritual vision which gave her rare insight into both the mind and heart of Christ.  She impressed her remarkable gifts, her wonderful consecration, her abounding love, her grand sympathy, upon the consciousness and into the fiber of all who knew her.  How large a circle of friends she bore in constant and loving remembrance!  In her private diary she carefully noted the birthdays and anniversaries of scores of those she loved, and on each recurring occasion of joy or sorrow a sweet note of congratulation or of sympathy was usually sent.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Strangely enough, she who so loved the beauties of nature, and so noted the changes of season and foliage, was denied the use of her eyes during her latter years.  As sight faded she accepted the loss as a part of the discipline of her life.  Not a murmur escaped her lips, nor did she allow the affliction to mar the spirits of her most intimate friends.  She learned to associate the faces of friends with their voices, and in the deprivation of sight she had recourse to imagination.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Even the baby grandchildren found pleasure in her sheltering love and tender sympathy.  She wrought for the Master till he came.  Blind and feeble as she was during the last year she still taught a Bible class of women, and diffused an influence for good among all whom she met.  Her character was a marvelous compound of gentleness and strength, of rare spiritual development and keen intellectual force.  A grand woman, she still lives in the memory of those who knew and loved her."</li>

Hastings, pastor of the church of Rochester, Ulster County, N.Y., died of paralysis, February 24th.  One or two previous strokes had somewhat crippled his efficiency, but he continued to work as long as he lived.  On the Sabbath before his death he preached to his people with tenderness and force.  Mr Hastings was in the sixty-third year of his age.  His earlier ministry was in the Presbyterian church in Central New York, where he was held in high esteem among his brethren.  For twenty years he ministered in the Reformed Dutch Church.  His life was beautiful in all the elements of manhood, friendship and piety, and his ministry was dignified, fervent, and full of the gospel.  His loss is to be lamented by his congregation as well as by personal friends and the family which clung to him so lovingly.  Mr. Hastings' last sermon was from Isaiah 62:10: "Life up a standard for the people."  The standard-bearer has fallen, but he is still a conqueror.  The Lord's standard is victorious in the death of those who have held it up with a firm faith and loving heart, as did our dear brother.<a href="e3104.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

The Consistory of the Reformed Dutch Church of Rochester, in behalf of the congregation as well as of themselves, place on record the following action suggested by the death of Rev. Seth P.M. Hastings, pastor of the church, which sad event occurred February 24th, 1876:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>"Resolved,</i> That we recognize this bereavement as the call of Divine Providence to greater faithfulness in improving the means of grace, which our Lord as given for our salvation.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>"Resolved,</i> That we affectionately remember the ministerial worth of our late pastor, ever faithful in proclaiming the gospel, wise and tender in his sympathies with his flock, ever making full proof of his ministry in the most loving spirit, and winning the hearty esteem and veneration of all, for whose sake he discharged the duties of his high office.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>"Resolved,</i>  That we recall with deepest interest the manner in which our lamented pastor bore all the trials which his Heavenly Father was pleased to lay upon him; manifesting, as he did, the sweetest resignation and calmest trust in Him whom he so thoroughly believed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>"Resolved, </i> That we solemnly call upon all the members of our church and congregation to lay to heart the lesson which God gives up in taking away our pastor, seeking to follow him as he followed Christ<br><i>"Resolved</i>, That this action be read from the pulpit of our church at divine service; that a copy of it be sent to Mrs. Hastings and the children of our dear pastor, and that it be published in The Christian Intelliger, the <i>Gospel Sower,</i> the <i>Rondout Freeman,</i> and the <i>Ellenville Journal.</i>  John Alliger, Clerk."<a href="e3105.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
<li id="c70.5">[<a href="s2.htm#s213">S213</a>] Newspaper article from the Scrapbook/Album maintained by Caroline S. Hastings, page 5.  Prof. North At Chittenango.  The Syracuse <i>Journal</i> of yesterday says:  Last evening, the last of the winter course of lectures before the Young Men's Christian Association of Chittenango, was delivered by Prof. Edward North, of Hamilton College.  He was introduced by Dr. Sherwood, president of the Young Men's Christian Association, and began by referring to a former visit to Chittenango on a similar errand, and paying a pleasant tribute to the memory of one who will long be remembered throughout central New York, his labors having been wide and useful, not only in Chittenango, but in Pompey, Moravia and elsewhere.  Prof. North said:<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If there were any in the audience who remembered Rev. Seth P.M. Hastings, as he stood in one of the pulpits of Chittenango twenty years ago, he had a fellow-rejoicing with them in the grateful memory of a good and true man.  Mr. Hastings belonged to a family of good and true men, men of the choicest New England stock, men who believed in the blessedness of large families, whose children were as arrows in the hand of a mighty man, and who happiness was in proportion as they had the quiver full of them.  His father was one of six brave brothers from Connecticut, of who Gerrit Smith once said, "Three of them were albinos, and all of them were honest."  One of them composed Sabbath hymns that have done more to prepare sinners for heaven than a dozen most eloquent preachers.  The most striking qualities of Rev. Seth P.M. Hastings were modesty, common sense, cheerfulness, fidelity.  He was always content wherever the Lord of the harvest gave him work to do.  And he did his work with joyous confidence in the fruitfulness of the truth faithfully preached.  He never sought the chief seat, but once place there, he filled it with dignity and tact.  He was remarkably large-hearted, wide-minded, free from cant  and censoriousness, with a habit of seeing the best side of men and things.  His perceptions were clear, his tastes refined, his judgment trustworthy.  His fixed aversion from attempting brilliant things saved him from saying or doing foolish things.  Probably there are devout souls in Chittenango, whose strength is nourished to-day by spiritual food received from his unpretending sermons preached in a neighboring pulpit twenty years ago.<a href="e3106.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Gott, daughter of Hon. Daniel Gott, of Pompey Hill, N. Y.  She was born August 27, 1825, and was descended from Charles Gott, who came with Gov. Endicott to Salem, Mass., in 1628.  One of her maternal ancestors was William Leete, first Governor of Connecticut, by whose protection the lives of the regicides, Whalley and Goff, were saved, they being for some weeks hidden in the cellar of his house at Guilford, Conn.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Francis H. Hasting received his education at the Clinton Academy and became a civil engineer.  The years which he spent in Northern and Central New York in surveying routes for railroads and canals, were full of congenial work and companionships, and his health was greatly benefitted by the out-door life.  All public improvements were stopped by the panic of 1837, and in 1842 he removed to Chicago, where the next ten years of his life were passed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was a nurseryman, and through all his subsequent life he retained pleasant memories of these years.  He was an active member of the Second Presbyterian Church and was much attached to both pastor and people.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1852 he removed to Rochester, and settled upon the fruit farm, three miles east of the city, where the remainder of his life was spent.  Though in very poor health when he first came to Rochester, he at once began, with characteristic energy, to transform the commonplace farm-house, with its barren surroundings, into the beautiful home, with its vines and flowers and fine shade trees, which grew to be under his skillful hand.  Here for more than forty years he enjoyed his garden, his books, and his friends, for he was an eminently hospitable man, keeping a warm welcome, particularly for those connected by family ties. Indeed, this very record attests his love of kindred, kept for sixty years of his laborious, active life, the later entries made when both sight and strength were failing.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In these days of art schools his singular gifts of caricature would have made him a successful illustrator, but in his youth there was small encouragement for an artist, and so he never cultivated his taste for art.  Whenever he was interrupted in reading, or while conversing with friends, his pencil would begin its work upon any convenient scrap or the margin of his newspaper, and face after face, curious and fantastic, but full of life and expression, would grow under his hand.  The older member of his father's family used to tell of the huge wood pile in the Clinton home.  It was the duty of the many boys of the household to saw the fire-wood, and he not only did his share of the work, but also decorated the end of every stick with a portrait.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His was an eminently sincere and affectionate nature.  His sound judgment and integrity made him safe counsellor, and his chief characteristic was a marvelous purity of heart, while his daily life was the expression of his simple, child-like Christian faith.  His home was a place of contentment, where the cares of life were not permitted to enter.  After the work of the day was over, it was his delight to spend an hour with his music, and the very spirit of peace seemed to breathe from the flute upon which he played for more than half a century.  The later evening was devoted to reading, for until the very last he was an indefatigable reader, especially of history.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was only a few months before his death, when impaired sight forbade any continued effort, that he listened with keenest pleasure to the whole of Parkman's works.  He was truly patriotic and kept himself well informed upon all question of public welfare.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His was a quiet life, nearly devoid of incident, but it was filled with unselfish devotion to his loved ones, with kind deeds for others, and it was truly a blessing to all who came within its influence.</li>

She was the sister of the late Mrs. Silas D. Childs, of Utica, and here she passed the happy days of her youth and early married life.  Her last years were saddened with constant sickness and suffering.  Yet her native cheerfulness and Christian spirit were a comfort to her friends in her darkest hours.  She had peculiar attractiveness to those who enjoy freedom from artificial restraint and hollow ceremony.  She hated shams and was never afraid to expose them.  She had sometimes a sharp word for pretension and double-dealing, and always a good word for whatsoever is beautiful and true in character and action.  She united with the Stone Church in Clinton, in the year 1843. <i> Utica Morning Herald.</i><a href="e3101.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

In our issue of last week we noted the death of one of our old and respected citizens, Rev. A.S. Wells.  Within the past few months The Ledger has requested a number of our old citizens to prepare for us a sketch of their lives for publication when death should call them.  As the first result of this request we present the following.  It was written by Mr. Wells but a few weeks previous to his death, and will be recognized as characteristic of the man, and we know will prove interesting to his many friends in Iowa.  The funeral was held at the Congregational church Wednesday last, Rev. M.E. Dwight conducting the services.  The remains were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery.<br><i> Editors Ledge</i>r:  In accordance with your request I have prepared, and now submit to your disposal, the outlines of my life, as one of the octogenarians of Jefferson county.  I find it no easy matter to give within the proper limits of a newspaper article the prominent figures and facts of a life protracted to near the close of 84 years; and I shrink from the attempt lest it should savor of ostentation.  But I am a witness for Christ, and desire to give my testimony to the world of what His free grace has done for me, who in my early life was the chief of sinners, and ever since a very unprofitable servant.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am the eldest son of Shipley and Dorothea Wells, and was born in Jericho, Vermont, Dec. 3d, 1798.  When about 15 years old, in answer to the prayers of a pious mother, I was born again in Washington, Me., and united with the Congregational church.  In 1819-1824 I entered and graduated at Hamilton College, in Clinton, Oneida county, N.Y.  There, in 1828, I married Sophia Hastings, daughter of Dr. Seth and Hulda Hastings, having previously taught the academy in Detroit for two years and taken a short course of theological study at Auburn.  Having a passion for the conversion of sinners and for the work of home evangelization in our western states, I was ordained to this work by the Presbytery of Oneida, at Utica, in February of this year, and as the pioneer of the Western Fraternity in Auburn, and under the commission of the A.H.M.S., went forth with my wife to New Albany, Ind., eight hundred miles from her father's home.  We were joyfully received by the members of a feeble Presbyterian church, having five male members, only one of whom could lead in prayer, and fifteen ladies, who sustained a female prayer meeting and a small Sabbath school.  The only place for holding religious meetings was a small gloomy court-house, and although a place of nearly two thousand inhabitants, had only occasional preaching; and a small M.E. church, whose house of worship was only bare walls covered with a roof, and its membership scarcely stronger than our own.  Intemperance was fearfully prevalent, as whisky was in every store, shop and steamboat, as free as water for customers, friends and workmen.  All the resistance to stay this tide of death and ruin was in these feeble churches, most of whose male members sanctioned the use of intoxicating drinks themselves.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here I began my home missionary work, and for four years labored to win souls to Christ; and through His blessings upon the word, and means of grace employed by myself and others, we had erected a good brick church and paid for it from our own means, gathered a good congregation, a large Sabbath-school, organized a vigorous temperance society and added one hundred and fifty to our membership, so that the whole moral character of the place was changed.  The revivals we enjoyed during those four years laid the foundation for its commercial prosperity and its religious improvement to this day.  There are now in that city three large and well established churches, and after fifty years have passed away there are in all of them valued members still holding forth the word of life who were brought into christian fellowship during that season of grace.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leaving New Albany in 1832, I settled in Tecumseh, Mich., and became pastor of the Presbyterian church there, and the first that was ever installed in that state.  Here, too, I was remarkably favored with revivals, one of which continued in some of our preaching places for two years.  Under their influence churches were organized in Clinton and Racine, and the way prepared to organize them in three other places.  Numbers of valuable members were gathered into them, both by examination and letters.  Houses of worship have since been erected, and these congregations are now the light and salt of those localities.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1836-40, similar results were secured in Troy, Oakland county, and in the neighboring towns of Rochester, Birmingham and Wing Lake; and in Mt. Clemens in another four year's pastorate, from 1840 to 1844.  From 1844 to 1850 I traveled over the state of Michigan and northern Indiana, and a part of Illinois and Wisconsin, in the service of the A.B.C.F. missions, and for six years labored to promote the cause of foreign missions in all the Presbyterian and Congregational churches in that district.  I then resumed my home missionary work, and for five years labored in the churches of Lima, Ontario and Springfield, in Indiana, and in Sturges Prairie, in Michigan.  This field of labor, although not barren of good fruits, was not as fruitful as those I had cultivated before.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1850 I removed to Iowa, and for the last twenty-seven years my home and center of operations has been in Fairfield.  From this point I went forth for several years and labored in the destitute churches in this state and in Illinois until I was laid aside on account of a diseased throat (laryngitis).  Since then I have canvassed Jefferson county, and mainly by personal visitation have supplied all who would receive the scriptures, and raised funds to pay off a debt that at one time amounted to nearly seven hundred dollars.  I have endeavored in Fairfield to be in all things a "faithful witness" for Christ.  And now on the borders of the grave and eternity, I feel happy in all the testimony I have given against slavery, intemperance, the use of tobacco, secret societies, and the use of alcoholic wine in the Lord's Supper, and in favor of the Bible as the word of God and the blessedness of the service of Jesus Christ.  I wish to leave it as my last testimony that He who saved me is able and willing to save to the uttermost all who will enthrone Him in their hearts, and assure them that they will find, as I have, that "Godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come."  My life work and my prayers I leave as a heritage for my beloved children and friends; and praying that they and you may follow me as I have.<a href="e3099.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

Last Sunday morning the sun arose radiant and beautiful, and as the Sabbath bells were calling the faithful to the house of worship, the bright and beautiful life of Harriett Lansing McNair went out.  It was indeed fitting that in the stillness and quiet of the hold Sabbath her spirit which so long had struggled amid infirmities should free itself and ascend to its heavenly home.  Mrs. McNair was the wife of Henry W. McNair, and daughter of the late Judge Hastings, and was born in this village October, 1834.  She was truly a woman of rare refinement, of a sweet and loving heart, a model of patience and usefulness.  Her gentle ways, symmetrical character, brilliant intellect, and charming conversational powers, attracted many to her pleasant home.  But while her womanly virtues and graceful manners greatly endeared her to all, it was around her fireside that her cheerful, transparent, and unselfish life shed its brightest charms.  With loving hands she was always ready for every good work.  The church, of which she was for many years an earnest and faithful member, shared largely in her labors.  Never weary of well doing, though at times her system was greatly impaired.  For some years she has suffered much from disease, but always was uncomplaining and buoyant.  Her death, though not unexpected, was sudden, and shocked our community.  The beloved one has gone, not again will her warm and affectionate greetings shed their endearing welcome over our pathway.  No more will her sweet voice make rich melody in the house of God.  Peacefully has she gone to rest, leaving pleasing memories that are not soon to be forgotten.  To mourn her departure she leaves a husband, one son, George H., and one daughter, Mary; four brothers, Fred E., and John M., of this village, George S., of New York, and Edward H., of Bath; three sisters, Miss Kittie, and Mrs. M.B. McNair, of this town; and Mrs. W. B. Thalheimer of Cincinnati, Ohio.  Her funeral will be attended this afternoon at one o'clock, from the family residence on Grove Street, Rev. Mr. Kittredge of Geneseo, and Rev. Dr. Parsons officiating.  <i>Mt. Morris Union</i>.<a href="e3110.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

McNair, died very suddenly on Sunday morning.  She had a stroke of paralysis on Friday from which she did not recover.  She was the daughter of the late Hon. Geo. Hastings, by his first wife, and her age was 46 years.  Mrs. McNair was first married to Lieut. Lee, and after his death became the wife of Mr. McNair.  She was a lady of refinement and a lovely Christian, and her death is a severe blow to a large circle of friends.  The funeral takes place Thursday afternoon.

For some years they resided in Washington, D. C., where he held a position in the Treasury Department.  As his health became more impaired he sought relief in travel, and died suddenly, October 11, 1873, in St. Paul, Minn.  He left three children.  Mrs. Lee married, second, March 10, 1875, Henry W.

Hastings,  <i>Family Record of Dr. Seth Hastings Senior of Clinton New York</i>, page 44-45.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The following account of Col. Hastings' war record is taken from a "History of the Class of 1857, of Hamilton college:"<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On August 19, 1862, he obtained from the Governor of New York authority to recruit a company for the Twenty-fourth New York Independent Battery of Light Artillery, then in the field. He very quickly secured the enlistment of over eight men for that battery, among whom were many college men.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The country was never more patriotic, and yielded the flower of her youth at that time for the sacred cause of Liberty and Union.  It was hard to leave wife and home, and in doing so he was actuated by a controlling sense of duty.  He was in active service until January, 1865, first with the rank of First Lieutenant, and finally receiving a commission as Brevet-Colonel.  For over a year he served as Judge-Advocate of the sub-District of the Albemarle, in North Carolina, and participated in several battles.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On April 20, 1864, while on duty at Plymouth, N. C., with a small brigade, numbering about two thousand men, he was captured after a series of engagements, commencing on April 17, and resulting finally, after repeated repulses of the enemy, in a grand charge over our earthworks and defenses, and the capture of the entire garrison after several hours' fighting with the defenses.  He was held as prisoner of war for nearly six months.  At this period of the war exchanges of prisoners had ceased.  He made four attempts to escape; the first was by means of a tunnel constructed with infinite labor during the night time, the only implements being a pair of hands, a broken gate-hinge and a jack-knife.  The period of construction was six weeks, length of tunnel forty feet, ventilation imperfect, caliber just sufficient for one person who has subsisted on Confederate diet for six months.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second scheme resulted in the escape of all engaged in it, with the exception of Colonel Hastings.  The third attempt was successful in a limited and disappointing sense; he traveled for four nights through the heart of Georgia, and was finally held up by one John Jackson, a Georgia planter, aided by three hounds and one black man.  His possession of a map of the country was regarded as positive proof of his being a spy.  He was sent in irons to the city of Savannah, held for a few hours in the cell of a jail, but was finally restored to the so-called rights of a prisoner of war.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"On October 11, 1864, with four New York officers, he succeeded in running the guard-line of a military prison camp in Columbia, S. C. After thirty-four days of adventure, with constant vigils and many narrow escapes from capture, the entire party reached the Union lines at an outpost near Knoxville, Tenn.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"As he was making preparations to return to the field he received a telegram from Governor Fenton, which resulted in his appointment, first, as military secretary of the Governor of New York, and shortly afterward as private secretary.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He resided in the city of Albany from January, 1865, to September, 1868, at which time he resigned and removed to the city of New York, resuming the practice of his profession.  He now resides in Morristown, N. J., having offices at No. 265 Broadway, New York.  He is the senior member of the law firm of Hastings & Gleason."</li>

Wednesday afternoon, 15th, our community was shocked at the announcement of the death of Mrs. Julia, wife of Miles B. McNair of this town, aged 42 years, after a brief and severe illness.  She was daughter of the late Judge Hastings, and was born in this village in May, 1839.  She was a woman of rare traits of character, intelligent, quiet, untiring and persistent in her daily duties, devoted to her family and friends, and supremely unselfish.  Her duties performed had their daily round, ever evincing under every trial the same sweet uncomplaining disposition, and earnest devotion to those about her.  The discipline of life had indeed perfected her transparent and beautiful character, as was said by one at her funeral, 'her life could be summed up in two words, unselfishness and fidelity.'  Truly her life was interwoven in the lives of those about her, and no wife, mother, or friend ever illustrated more fully and delightfully the christian graces.  She was a faithful member of the Presbyterian Church, and a constant attendant, and no weariness could keep her from every Sabbath gathering her infant class, as with remarkable simplicity she unfolded to them the simple stories of the holy word.  Her death has cast a dark shadow over many a heart, while her gentle ways, kindness of heart, disinterestedness, and pure love, have left their sweet fragrance in many a household.  To mourn her sudden and unexpected departure she leaves a family of seven children, whose correct training indicate the sure reward of maternal fidelity; a husband, mother, four brothers, George S., of New York, Edward H., of Bath, Fred E., of Little Rock, Arkansas, and John M., of this village; two sisters, Kittie of this village, and Mrs. Thalheimer of Cincinnati, Ohio; and a large circle of friends.  Her funeral was on Saturday, one of the most delightful days in June, from the family residence, now occupied by Henry W. McNair, from which so many of her father's family had been followed to our beautiful resting place for the dead.  Impressive remarks were made on this occasion by Rev. Dr. Parsons and Rev. Mr. Kittredge.  The bearers were H.W. Miller, S.L. Rockfellow, Henry Cox, Joshua Weeks.<a href="e3114.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
