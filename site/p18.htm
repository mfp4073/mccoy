He located at Irwin, Station, Pennsylvania, became a coal miner and was married to Mary A. Bowie, sister of Alexander Bowie, one of the early pioneers in New Mexico, March 25, 1873. Stewart went to Rockville, Colorado in 1879 and helped sink Rockville Shaft No. 1.  He then moved to Carthage, New Mexico. During the early 80's he was with Bowie exploring and prospecting for coal in the southwest for the Santa Fe Railroad.  With their covered wagon and saddle horses, they covered every section of New Mexico, southern Colorado and northern Mexico. His first trip to Gallup was in 1880.  Traveling north from Socorro he entered the valley of Rio Puerco at the buttes west of Gallup.  He returned in 1882, when the Atlantic and Pacific railroad was doing business in a box car. After completing the prospecting he located at Blosburg and then went to Cerillos.  He returned to Gallup in the spring of 1887 to put down a prospect shaft where Gallup's Steam Laundry now stands.

<li id="c531.3">[<a href="s4.htm#s119">S119</a>] Obituary of John Bocklett.  John Bocklett Killed.  March 14, 1900.  Engineer Bocklett, was killed by being run over Wednesday night, on his way into Gallup, with a train.  Mr. Bocklett was in charge of No. 4, the eastbound flyer, and on its arrival at Pinta, where a double headed freight was side tracked, decided to take his engine off of the flyer on account of a hot pin, and give the train into charge of the first engine of the freight train.  He did this and attached his engine to the extra freight running without incident as far as Luna, where a fire was discovered on top of a car four lengths back from the train, which was made up of 77 cars.  Bocklett insisted on going back himself to quench the fire.  Started with a bucket of water and passed between the second and third cars lost his balance and fell between the cars to the track below, the entire train passing over him.  Engineer Frank Jones, was at the throttle and Will Carman was conductor in charge.  The accident occurred at 8:50 when Bocklett did not show up and no impression made on the fire, Jack Myrick, the fireman whistled for a stop and went back finding no trace of his engineer and on reaching the caboose sent Carman back along the track and about half a mile back from the engine discovered the unfortunate man.  The train had severed both legs near the body but he was found to be conscious.  When Carman reached him, he asked to hold his hand, saying that he was getting cold.  While the crew was engaged in setting out the train at Luna, 22 miles west of Gallup, when the accident occurred, Bocklett asked for his wife.  The engines were coupled as soon as possible and started for Gallup.  He breathed his last at Manuelito, New Mexico. The sad ending of a bright young life has cast a gloom over the whole community.  By years of social intercourse he had secured a place in the hearts of our people which it will be hard for another to fill.  In every path of life he has showed himself to be that noblest work of studious disposition who used his mind for the benefit of his fellow men. Charitable to a fault, a consistent member of the Catholic Church, a self made man who against adverse circumstances fought his was upward in the battle of life.  No engineer in the employ of the Santa Fe Pacific stood higher in the roads estimates than he did.  The engineers and firemen to whom he was endeared by his kindly disposition and strict sense of justice feel deeply the loss they have sustained and sent many representatives to testify to the love they bear to their lost brother.  The Gleaner joins with them and the many friends of the family in the heartfelt expressions of sincere sympathy to the stricken wife and children to whom is left nothing now but the contemplation of the virtues of him who is gone forever. John Bocklett was born in Bavaria, Germany, November 16, 1862.  The family came to America in 1874 and lived in Springfield, Ohio two years then removed to Greenfield, Greene County, Ill., afterwards moving to Denison, Texas, where his father, mother, three brothers and one sister now live.  One brother Mark Bocklett, is an engineer on the Santa Fe Pacific, and is now here.  John Bocklett came to Albuquerque in 1882 and has been in the employ of the S. F. P.  R. R. ever since.  On the 26th of January 1892, he was married to Miss Emma Frances Bowie, who with their children is left to mourn his loss; Anne age 8 years, George age 5 years and Agnes aged 3 years.  Mr. John Smith, an uncle, arrived from Albuquerque, on Friday to attend the funeral which will take place from the residence tomorrow at 10 A. M.  He carried insurance on his life to the amount of $8,000 and had valuable real estate in Gallup, Albuquerque and Texas. A number of engineers and fireman will be here to attend the funeral, the following arrived on Thursday; Messrs. W. A. Lavis, Walter Jones and wife, Bob Harris, Joe Brown, Charles Daze, Robert and William Kelly. His father and mother and brothers will arrive from Texas tomorrow.<a href="e2066.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>

<li id="c537.2">[<a href="s4.htm#s439">S439</a>] Letter from Johnie Bogue to  <i>Ethel Benham</i> dated 8 Feb 1968, Dear Ethel & James, I want to thank you for inviting me to dinner and meeting Eliz. Ann and her husband.  Sorry for my out bust of temper over my mother.  This story has been happening to me so often and as far back as I can remember.  When the family lived in Carthage, N. Mex., mother was in her teens.  Grandma Bowie taught all her daughters to read and write.  They had to learn a scripture and psalm from her Bible each day.  The Bible was their Class Book, and contained all the family history.  She made each one of the girls learn to sew, knit, crochet and all household chores.  The old times did not give the girls an education as they did the boys.  Only the men folks were allowed to attend school.  While the family was living in Carthage, N. Mex., mother took a job sewing for a wealthy Spanish family living in Silver City, N. Mex.  She lived here with them almost a year.  During this time, she met a Mr. Scott, another prospector looking for gold, silver, etc.  They were married by some old fellow passing as a lawyer.  Scott took mother down to Socorro, N. M.  Just before Cora (my oldest sister) was born.  Mr. Scott went out prospecting into Mexico and was never heard of again.  Grandma Bowie went to Socorro, N. Mex., and brought mother and Cora to Gallup with her where the family had all moved to.  Here she lived with her family until she married my father.  Grandpa Bowie had a small general store here and Aunt Maggie Cunningham and mother had a novelty, millinery and dress making place in this store too.  The family hard feelings arose over the money my mother received at the death of my father.  Uncle Alex Bowie wanted mother to give him the $10,000 she received from father&#8217;s insurance and the money the Railroad Co. gave her.  Mother said no, she would keep the money and property in the hands of Mr. Dickson, my father&#8217;s lawyer.  Uncle Alex wanted the money to invest in his mines.  And Uncle Alex Bowie&#8217;s marriage to Elizabeth Whinney.  Just before Uncle Alex Bowie received his degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in Civil Engineering, an Elizabeth Whinney and her family came to the Bowie home in Bo&#8217;ness, Scotland and claimed Grandpa Bowie was the father of her unborn child.  So the story goes, the Whinney family threatened the Bowie family.  Uncle Alex Bowie married Eliz. Whinney and came to the United States.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When mother was leaving Gallup, N. Mex., to make her home in Winslow with us girls, her packing boxes were broken into, the family Bible, the deeds to three lots on the East side of Gallup, all her silver, Indian rugs, Indian baskets and painted dishes, my father&#8217;s sister had given them as wedding presents were stolen.  The lots were sold to an out-of-town party, and he built a big concrete garage on them, realizing he did not have clear title to the property, contacted my mother and the property was settled out of court, in Albuquerque, N. Mex.  Alex Bowie had the Bible and took it to Bowie, Colorado, which he gave to his father and mother. Grandma Bowie carried a grudge in her heart over this marriage.  She had such a high hopes for her son and his future.  She never got along with Eliz. Bowie her daughter-in-law, and received several beatings from Grandpa Bowie over it.  Mother and Maggie Cunningham always stuck up for Grandma Bowie, this same hard feeling and misunderstanding has been going on for years.My sister Anne Clarke and I have been gathering material for our family history in N. Mex., and will give you a copy if you would like to have it.  In the meantime, I have started to ball rolling with a genealogist in Scotland for further family data.  Ellen Speaker gave me some data on her family.  I have a few more dates to gather for my family genealogy, will give you a copy of ours too.  And again I would like to apologize for upsetting you about mother.  It was very gracious of you folks to invite me to your gathering and for the nice dinner.  I love you for both.  Thanking you again.  Love, Johnie Eliz. Bogue.<a href="e3396.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e3397.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e3398.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a><a href="e3399.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
