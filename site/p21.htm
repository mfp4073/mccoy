Only three weeks before she was found shot to death along Arapahoe Road, an elderly woman told neighbors she had inherited "quite a lot" of money.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elizabeth Newcomb, 78, of 4535 Lowell Blvd., has been identified as the woman deputies found Sunday evening shot through the head.  She may have been the victim of a robbery attempt, sheriff's deputies said.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A 24-year old Wheat Ridge man was being held Wednesday for investigation in the slaying.  He had earlier tried to help authorities identify the body, said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Lt. Less Murrey.  Officers said they would not identify the man unless charges are filed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Newcomb's daughter, Eleanor Ahern, said she last saw her mother at 5:15 p.m. Sunday, about three hours before her death.

Woman's death shocks neighbors<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neighbors of Mrs. Newcomb were shocked at the news of the slaying.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She was a wonderful woman, very sturdy," said Eugene Beatty, 68, a patron of Billy's Inn, a tavern at 4403 Lowell Blvd., two blocks from Mrs. Newcomb's home.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He said the longtime area resident would come to the inn about once a week to have a couple of beers and discuss affairs with other older citizens who congregate there.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He said he had not heard of the inheritance, although he did remember Mrs. Newcomb buying several household items recently, including new carpet.<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;BUT MRS. NEWCOMB'S friend and neighbor, Mrs. Geneviere Wood, said Mrs. Newcomb had told her three weeks before her death that an old mining claim once held by her grandfather had recently been purchased.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"She said it came to quite a bit," Mrs. Wood said.  Other neighbors also remembered Mrs. Newcomb telling them she had come into a lot of money.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By late Wednesday, sheriff's deputies had yet to determine where the apparent abduction of Mrs. Newcomb took place.  They speculated she was abducted from her home, driven to Arapahoe County and shot.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The porch light was still burning at the entrance to the garden-level apartment of the two-story brick home she and her husband purchased in 1955.  Mrs. Newcomb rented out the upstairs rooms.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Andi Brewington, another neighbor, said Mrs. Newcomb was an accomplished gardner who entertained herself with her indoor plants, her cat and her dog.<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WHEN OFFICERS ARRIVED at the house, the dog, Misty, a well-kept poodle, was barking.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that the dog was home but Mrs. Newcomb was gone led Mrs. Wood to believe the worst had happened.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If she came over, she'd bring Misty.  Misty would be with her when she was doing lawn work.  The dog was always with her," Mrs. Wood said.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mrs. Newcomb's northwest Denver neighborhood is made up mostly of long-standing homeowners at or near retirement age.  But even homeowners who said they had been in the area for nearly 20 years said Mrs. Newcomb was among the oldest homeowners.<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;BEATTY SAID HE FIRST met Mrs. Newcomb 18 years ago when he moved into the neighborhood.  He said her husband, Joseph E. Newcomb, a master plumber, died in 1962.  "He left her well taken care of," Beatty said.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike many other neighborhoods in Denver, homeowners five houses away from Mrs. Newcomb knew her by name.  All said they could not believe anyone would harm a lady who always went out of her way to say hello, and seldom complained.<a href="e3410.htm"><img src="picicon.gif" alt="" class="icon" title="Click to view image"></a></li>
